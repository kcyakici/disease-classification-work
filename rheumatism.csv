The absence of typical symptoms makes early diagnosis challenging. This study aims to systematically review FR cases and present a case from our center to provide a comprehensive description of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment, thereby assisting clinicians in early identification and timely management of FR, ultimately leading to improved prognosis.
FR is a rare fibroproliferative disease with an unknown etiology. It is characterized by rapidly progressive and destructive symmetrical inflammatory multiple arthritis. Here, we present a rare case of a 50-year-old female with symmetric inflammatory polyarthritis. We highlight the importance of a comprehensive medical history, histopathology, immunohistochemistry, and clinical manifestations of skin nodules, arthralgia, and arthritis for successful disease diagnosis. Despite employing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, methotrexate, and tacrolimus, the patient's symptoms did not resolve, and joint destruction continued to progress. Early diagnosis, aggressive treatment with appropriate use of steroids and immunosuppressants, and further research to identify effective treatment strategies are crucial in preventing detrimental joint destruction and limb contractures.
A comprehensive review of the available literature emphasizes the importance of early and accurate diagnosis coupled with appropriate treatment for achieving favorable outcomes and preventing joint destruction and limb contractures."
3,37439522,2023-07-13,Effects of iguratimod in the treatment of palindromic rheumatism: Case report.,N/A,"Palindromic rheumatism (PR) is characterized by interstitial inflammation, redness, and pain in joints and periarticular tissues. However, the pathogenesis and treatment of PR remain unknown. Herein, we report on the first use of iguratimod (IGU) - a novel small-molecule compound with anti-inflammatory effects - in the treatment of refractory PR.
A male patient aged 70 years was diagnosed with PR based on medical history, clinical manifestations, and ultrasound findings. The patient was treated with IGU (25 mg PO q.d.). The disease activity was measured by the frequency of PR flares and clinical symptoms. The patient's laboratory tests were monitored for safety reasons.
The use of IGU significantly improved pain symptoms and reduced flare frequency. After 28 days of treatment, abnormal levels of glutamic-pyruvic transaminase were observed. One month after discontinuation of IGU, flares occurred in the patient's second toe of both feet.
IGU provides a new treatment option for patients with refractory PR who cannot use hydroxychloroquine. The effective treatment with IGU suggests the potential pathogenesis of PR and provides a basis for physicians to choose a new drug for PR treatment."

In this study, we determined the effects of IGU on disease control in patients with palindromic rheumatism (PR).
Patients with PR were divided into Control group (Ctrl group) and an IGU treatment (IGU group) groups. Drug efficacy was evaluated according to the frequency of PR attacks (monthly), the visual analog scale (VAS) score of patient pain, and clinical symptoms.
The drug positivity and disease control rates of the IGU group (100.00% and 90.91%, respectively) were significantly higher than those of the Ctrl group (61.11% and 5.56%; p = .002 and p < .001, respectively). The median number of PR flares and the VAS score of patients in the Ctrl group decreased from 3.00 (1.00-15.00) to 0.83 (0.00-12.00) and from 5 (4-6) to 4 (1-6), respectively. In the IGU group, the median number of PR attacks decreased from 4.50 (2.00-15.00) to 0.00 (0.00-0.33), and the VAS score decreased from 5 (4-6) to 0 (0-2). The IGU group exhibited a significant reduction in PR flare frequency and improvement in the VAS value (p < .001 and p < .001, respectively).
Our study is the first to describe the efficacy of IGU in PR treatment. IGU can significantly reduce the number of PR flares and improve the clinical symptoms of patients with PR."

Some patients have persistent symptoms despite colchicine intake. Mast cells (MC) are innate immune cells involved in inflammatory conditions including AID. Their activation is responsible for various symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating and pruritus.
Our objective was to evaluate features of a systemic MC activation in FMF adult patients.
FMF adult patients prospectively filled a MC activation survey and usual MC mediators (tryptase and histamine in whole blood, plasma and urine) were measured. They were compared with a healthy control group (HC) and a systemic mastocytosis (SM) group. When digestive biopsies were realized during follow-up, MC infiltration in digestive mucosa was analyzed in FMF, in comparison with SM, Crohn disease (CD) and normal biopsies.
Forty-four FMF patients, 44 HC and 44 SM patients were included. Thirty-one (70%) FMF patients had symptoms of mast cell activation, versus 14 (32%) in the HC group (p = 0.0006). Thirty (68%) FMF patients had at least one elevated MC mediator: mainly whole blood histamine, in 19 (43%) and urinary histamine, in 14 (32%), which were significantly higher than in HC subjects. MC infiltration was comparable in FMF digestive biopsies, biopsies of CD and normal biopsies but was lower than in SM biopsies.
FMF patients show frequent symptoms of MC activation and an increase of blood or urinary histamine never described before in this disease. This suggests an implication of MC and possibly basophils in FMF pathophysiology."

Between January 2018 and January 2019, a total of 256 SSc patients (20 males, 236 females; mean age: 50.9±12.4 years; range, 19 to 87 years) who were diagnosed with SSc were included in the study. Disability and health-related QoL (HRQoL) were evaluated by the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), scleroderma HAQ (SHAQ), Duruöz Hand Index (DHI), and Short Form-36 (SF-36). Linear regression analysis methods were used to describe factors associated with disability and QoL of the patients.
All disability scores were higher and HRQoL scores were lower in diffuse cutaneous SSc patients compared limited cutaneous SSc, and differentiations were significant (p=0.001 and p=0.007). In multiple regression, pain (VAS) was the strongest predictor for high disability and low QoL scores (p<0.001) as HAQ (β=0.397, 0.386, 0.452), SHAQ (β=0.397, 0.448, 0.372), DHI (β=0.446, 0.536, 0.389), PCS (β=-0.417,-0.499, -0.408) and MCS (β=-0.478, -0.441, -0.370) in combined, lcSSc and dcSSc patients respectively. The factors associated with high disability and low QoL scores were forced vital capacity for HAQ (β=-0.172, p=0.002) and SF-36 PCS (β=0.187, p=0.001); disease duration for HAQ (β=0.208, p<0.001), DHI (β=0.147, p=0.006), and SF-36 PCS (β=-0.134, p=0.014); 6-minute walk test for HAQ (β=-0.161, p=0.005) and SF-36 PCS (β=0.153, p=0.009); and modified Rodnan skin score for SHAQ (β=0.250, p<0.001) and DHI (β=0.233, p<0.001) in SSc patients. Diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide for HAQ (β=-0.189, p=0.010) and SHAQ (β=-0.247, p=0.002); erythrocyte sedimentation rate for DHI (β=0.322, p<0.001); age for SF-36 PCS (β=-0.221, p=0.003) and body mass index for SF-36 PCS (β=-0.200, p=0.008) and MCS (β=-0.175, p=0.034) were the other variables associated with high disability or low QoL scores in SSc subsets.
Clinicians should consider the management of the pain and its sources as a key to improve better functional state and quality of daily life in SSc."
8,37219934,2023-05-23,Identification of Distinct Genetic Profiles of Palindromic Rheumatism Using Whole-Exome Sequencing.,N/A,"Previous studies have underlined the genetic susceptibility in the pathogenesis of palindromic rheumatism (PR), but the known PR loci only partially explain the disease's genetic background. We aimed to genetically identify PR by whole-exome sequencing (WES).
This multicenter prospective study was conducted in 10 Chinese specialized rheumatology centers between September 2015 and January 2020. WES was performed in 185 patients with PR and in 272 healthy controls. PR patients were divided into PR subgroups who were negative for anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA-) and positive for ACPA (ACPA+) according to ACPA titer (cutoff value 20 IU/liter). We conducted whole-exome association analysis for the WES data. We used HLA imputation to type HLA genes. In addition, we used the polygenic risk score to measure the genetic correlations between PR and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the genetic correlations between ACPA- PR and ACPA+ PR.
Among 185 patients with PR enrolled in our study, 50 patients (27.02%) were ACPA+ and 135 PR patients (72.98%) were ACPA-. We identified 8 novel loci (in the ACPA- PR group: ZNF503, RPS6KL1, HOMER3, HLA-DRA; in the ACPA+ PR group: RPS6KL1, TNPO2, WASH2P, FANK1) and 3 HLA alleles (in the ACPA- PR group: HLA-DRB1*0803 and HLA-DQB1; in the ACPA+ PR group: HLA-DPA1*0401) that were associated with PR and that surpassed genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10

A total of 308 participants were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. We recorded their clinical characteristics and performed propensity-score matching (PSM). Serum 25(OH)D3 levels were determined via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
Our PSM resulted in 48 patients with PR and 96 matched control individuals. The multivariate regression analysis we performed after the PSM did not show a significant increase in PR risk in patients with vitamin D deficiency/insufficiency. There was no significant correlation between levels of 25(OH)D3 and frequency/duration of attacks, number of joints affected, and duration of symptoms before diagnosis (P ≥ .05). Mean (SD) serum levels of 25(OH)D3 in patients with and without progression to RA were 28.7 (15.9) ng/mL and 25.1 (11.4) ng/mL, respectively.
Based on the results, we found no clear association between vitamin D serum levels and the risk, severity, and rate of PR progressing into RA."
10,37192377,2023-05-16,Refining Incidence and Characteristics of Inflammatory Myopathies: A Quadruple-Source Capture-Recapture Survey Using the 2017 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology Classification Criteria.,N/A,"Inflammatory myopathies (IM), characterized by muscle inflammation and weakness, are rare systemic diseases. Our previous study estimated an IM incidence rate of 7.98 cases per million people per year (95% confidence interval 7.38-8.66) and highlighted important variations that were likely because of methodologic issues rather than true epidemiologic differences. In this study, we aimed to refine the incidence of IM, using the 2017 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for IM and a quadruple-source capture-recapture method during a 6-year period in Alsace, France, a region with a population of 2 million having benefits of good access to health care and accredited IM referral centers.
Clinical data of potential IM patients were obtained from 4 sources (general practitioners and community specialists, public and private hospital records, public and private laboratories, and archives from the pathology department). Patients residing in Alsace and who fulfilled the 2017 EULAR/ACR criteria for IM between January 1, 2006, and January 1, 2013, were included. We corrected potentially incomplete ascertainment of cases with capture-recapture analyses. We studied both spatial and temporal distributions of incidence of IM. We also assessed systemic manifestations of the disease.
Our review of 1,742 potential cases identified 106 patients with IM. No spatial or temporal heterogeneity was observed. Use of log-linear models showed an estimated 14.9 additional missed cases. Thus, the incidence rate of IM was 8.22 new cases per million inhabitants per year (95% confidence interval 6.76-9.69). Extramuscular manifestations other than dermatomyositis rash were frequently recorded.
The stringent methodology used in our study provides an accurate estimation of the incidence of IM. This study also demonstrates, in a population-based cohort, the systemic nature of IM."

Multiple cardiac hemangiomas are even rarer with only three cases published in the literature. Pathologically it can be divided into cavernous hemangioma, capillary hemangioma, arteriovenous hemangioma, mixed-type hemangioma, and so on. At present, the etiology of cardiac hemangioma is not completely clear. In this study, we present multiple cardiac hemangiomas located in the right atrium and discuss the new unreported possible cause (rheumatism) of cardiac hemangioma. This is the fourth case of multiple cardiac hemangiomas in the medical literature and the first time to present rheumatism as the cause of cardiac hemangioma.
A 53-year-old man presented to the clinic with intermittent chest tightness and shortness of breath for 2 years. On echocardiography, multiple soft tissue masses in the right atrium were found. The patient had rheumatic heart disease with severe mitral stenosis and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Two masses with a diameter of about 20 mm and 15 mm were seen in the right atrium. One mass was located on the inferior margin of the fossa ovalis and the other was adjacent to the inferior vena cava. Both masses were successfully removed surgically. The mitral valve replacement and tricuspid valve plasty were performed at the same time. The postoperative histopathology results confirmed the diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma.
The occurrence of multiple hemangiomas in the heart is possible, especially in the presence of rheumatism. Rheumatism is one of the possible etiologies of cardiac hemangioma. Cardiologists and cardiac surgeons should be aware of its occurrence and should consider cardiac hemangioma as a differential diagnosis especially in rheumatic heart disease patients when they present with soft tissue cardiac masses for accurate management."

However, whether this is linked to the disease or to its treatment is difficult to determine. This study aimed to identify factors associated with occurrence of severe COVID-19 in AIRD patients and to evaluate whether having an AIRD was associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 or death.
Two databases were analyzed: the EDS (Entrepôt des Données de Santé, Clinical Data Warehouse), including all patients followed in Paris university hospitals and the French multi-center COVID-19 cohort [French rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD)]. First, in a combined analysis we compared patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19 to identify factors associated with severity. Then, we performed a propensity matched score case-control study within the EDS database to compare AIRD cases and non-AIRD controls.
Among 1,213 patients, 195 (16.1%) experienced severe COVID-19. In multivariate analysis, older age, interstitial lung disease (ILD), arterial hypertension, obesity, sarcoidosis, vasculitis, auto-inflammatory diseases, and treatment with corticosteroids or rituximab were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19. Among 35,741 COVID-19 patients in EDS, 316 having AIRDs were compared to 1,264 Propensity score-matched controls. AIRD patients had a higher risk of severe COVID-19 [aOR = 1.43 (1.08-1.87), p = 0.01] but analysis restricted to rheumatoid arthritis and spondyloarthritis found no increased risk of severe COVID-19 [aOR = 1.11 (0.68-1.81)].
In this multicenter study, we confirmed that AIRD patients treated with rituximab or corticosteroids and/or having vasculitis, auto-inflammatory disease, and sarcoidosis had increased risk of severe COVID-19. Also, AIRD patients had, overall, an increased risk of severe COVID-19 compares general population."

Approximately 44% of participants were diagnosed with diabetes, 28% with rheumatoid arthritis, and around 25% with multiple sclerosis. Two psychometric measures were used to achieve the objectives of the present study: the Psychological Resilience Scale and the Performance of Social and Occupational Functions Scale. Regression analyses were used to examine the amount of variance predicted by psychological resilience in terms of the following variables of social and professional functions: relationships, communication, social activities, entertainment activities, life skills, employment-based job functions, and unemployment-based job functions. Results revealed that psychological resilience positively predicted social and occupational functions among all illnesses. Resilience best predicted social and professional functions among MS patients, followed by diabetes patients and RA patients. These findings highlight the role of psychological resilience in improving the social and occupational performance of patients with chronic illnesses and the positive relationship between employment and resilience."

For many years, our understanding of rheumatism was seriously hindered by technology constraints. However, the increasing application and rapid advancement of sequencing technology in the past decades have enabled us to study rheumatism with greater accuracy and in more depth. Sequencing technology has made huge contributions to the field and is now an indispensable component and powerful tool in the study of rheumatism.
Articles on sequencing and rheumatism, published from 1 January 2000 to 25 April 2022, were retrieved from the Web of Science™ (Clarivate™, Philadelphia, PA, USA) database. Bibliometrix, the open-source tool, was used for the analysis of publication years, countries, authors, sources, citations, keywords, and co-words.
The 1,374 articles retrieved came from 62 countries and 350 institutions, with a general increase in article numbers during the last 22 years. The leading countries in terms of publication numbers and active cooperation with other countries were the USA and China. The most prolific authors and most popular documents were identified to establish the historiography of the field. Popular and emerging research topics were assessed by keywords and co-occurrence analysis. Immunological and pathological process in rheumatism, classification, risks and susceptibility, and biomarkers for diagnosis were among the hottest themes for research.
Sequencing technology has been widely applied in the study of rheumatism and propells research in the area of discovering novel biomarkers, related gene patterns and physiopathology. We suggest that further efforts be made to advance the study of genetic patterns related to rheumatic susceptibility, pathogenesis, classification and disease activity, and novel biomarkers."

The possible association with treatment and damage was also investigated.
One hundred thirty-three consecutive adult systemic lupus erythematosus patients according to the 2019 EULAR/ACR criteria were divided according to the presence (RENAL-lupus) or absence of renal involvement (NONRENAL-lupus) at disease onset. The 2019 EULAR/ACR score and Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics/ACR (SDI) were longitudinally evaluated over 3 years.
RENAL-lupus (n = 49 [36.8%]) and NONRENAL-lupus (n = 84 [63.2%]) were similar regarding age ( p = 0.704), female sex ( p = 0.313), and black race ( p = 0.506). At study entry, RENAL-lupus had higher 2019 EULAR/ACR total domains (30 [12-42] vs. 22 [10-36], p < 0.001) and used more often glucocorticoid ( p < 0.001), mycophenolate mofetil ( p = 0.007), and cyclophosphamide ( p = 0.001). After 3 years, a stable number of domain scores was observed for the RENAL-lupus (30 [12-42] vs. 30 [12-42], p = 0.125), whereas an increase was observed for the NONRENAL-lupus (22 [10-36] vs. 23 [10-40], p < 0.001) compared with baseline. Accordingly, RENAL-lupus patients had a lower frequency of additional domains (3/49 [6.1%] vs. 37/84 [44.0%], p < 0.0001). New kidney involvement occurred in 15 (44.1%) of 34 patients of the NONRENAL-lupus. Both groups evolved with a comparable increase in frequency of patients with damage (SDI ≥1) at the end of the study (23/49 [46.9%] vs. 34/89 [40.54%], p = 0.585) with a similar median of SDI (1 [0-4] vs. 0 [0-2], p = 0.132).
The distinct pattern of accrual 2019 EULAR/ACR domains in patients with and without nephritis at disease onset suggests that close surveillance for additional organ involvement, including kidney, is mandatory in NONRENAL lupus in the first 3 years of disease. The unexpected comparable early damage in both groups despite milder disease and less intense immunosuppression in NONRENAL lupus reinforces the need for new and tailored therapies for these patients."

A prospective cohort study of AAV was conducted based on data acquired by the Chinese Rheumatism Data Center (CRDC). The cohort involved 140 patients diagnosed with AAV in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University from January 2013 to April 2022. Clinical characteristics and prognostic data were prospectively collected. The patients were divided into an ESRD group and a non-ESRD group, a death group and a survival group, Then, univariate and multivariate COX regression models were used to determine the risk factors associated with ESRD and mortality by AAV.
Multivariate Cox regression results showed that high initial serum creatinine (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.001, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.000-1.002, P = 0.024), high initial Birmingham vasculitis activity score (BVAS) (HR = 1.081, 95% CI: 1.027-1.138, P = 0.003), and the need for dialysis treatment (HR = 4.918, 95% CI: 1.727-14.000, P = 0.003) were independent risk factors for the progression of ESRD in AAV patients. Multivariate Cox regression results showed that alveolar hemorrhage (HR = 3.846, 95% CI: 1.235-11.973, P = 0.020), interstitial lung disease (HR = 4.818, 95% CI: 1.788-12.982, P = 0.002), and low initial estimated glomerular filtration rate (EGFR) (HR = 0.981, 95% CI: 0.968-0.995, P = 0.009) were independent risk factors for the prediction of death in AAV patients.
These findings suggest that high initial serum creatinine, a high initial BVAS score, and the need for dialysis were independent risk factors for the progression of ESRD in AAV patients. Alveolar hemorrhage, interstitial lung disease, and low initial EGFR were independent risk factors for death. Key Points • The risk factors for ESRD in AAV determined in this study are high initial serum creatinine, a high initial BVAS score, and the need for dialysis. • The risk factors for mortality in AAV are alveolar hemorrhage, interstitial lung disease, and low initial EGFR."

PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases were searched for literature comparing the three classification criteria of ACR-1997, SLICC-2012 and EULAR/ACR-2019, which took clinical diagnosis as reference. Meta-analysis was used to evaluate and compare the sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratio of ACR-1997, SLICC-2012 and EULAR/ACR-2019. To assess the early diagnosis capability of the classification criteria, subgroups of patients with disease duration < 3 years and < 1 year were selected for comparison of sensitivity and specificity based on the inclusion of the original study. The sensitivity and specificity of each item in three sets of classification criteria were evaluated. In addition, the clinical and immunological characteristics of patients who did not meet the three classification criteria were compared.
Nine original studies were included in the analysis, including 6404 SLE patients and 3996 controls. Results showed that the diagnostic odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of the SLICC-2012 [136.35 (114.94, 161.75)] and EULAR/ACR-2019 [187.47 (158.00, 222.42)] were higher than those of the ACR-1997 [67.53 (58.75, 77.63)].

The specificity of the three classification criteria was similar: ACR-1997, SLICC-2012, and EULAR/ACR-2019 were 0.93 (0.89, 0.95), 0.86 (0.79, 0.91), and 0.91 (0.85, 0.95), respectively. The sensitivity of SLICC-2012 and EULAR/ACR-2019 were higher than that of ACR-1997 in early-course subgroups. Patients who did not meet ACR-1997 had more hypocomplementemia, patients who did not meet SLICC-2012 had more cutaneous lupus and photosensitivity, and patients who did not meet EULAR/ACR-2019 had more cutaneous lupus and leucopenia.
SLICC-2012 and EULAR/ACR-2019 have better diagnostic ability than the ACR-1997, and the sensitivity of the former two criteria is also higher than that of the latter; Moreover, the SLICC-2012 and EULAR/ACR-2019 for patients in the early stages of disease performed equally excellent."

We assessed these mechanisms further by systematically comparing thermal pain thresholds and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) between patients with active RA or Spa and healthy controls. We included 50 patients with RA and 50 patients with Spa and 100 age-matched and sex-matched controls. Heat and cold pain thresholds (HPT-CPT) were measured on the dominant forearm, and CPM was assessed by applying conditioning stimuli (immersion in a cold-water bath) to one foot and the nondominant hand in 2 successive randomized sequences. Descending pain modulation was assessed as the difference in HPTs (in °C) before and after conditioning. Larger HPT differences (ie, a larger CPM effect) reflected more efficient descending inhibition. Potential associations between changes in CPM and clinical data, including disease activity, pain intensity, and psychological and functional variables, were systematically assessed. Heat pain threshold and cold pain threshold were similar in patients and controls. The mean CPM effect was significantly weaker in patients than that in controls for conditioning applied to either the foot (0.25°C ±2.57 vs 2.79°C ±2.31; P < 0.001) or the nondominant hand (0.57°C ±2.74 vs 2.68°C ±2.12; P < 0.001). The smaller CPM effect in patients was correlated with average pain intensity, but not with disease activity or other clinical characteristics, suggesting a significant pathophysiological role for changes in endogenous pain modulation in the mechanisms of chronic pain associated with inflammatory rheumatism."

Based on the similarity of the pathogenesis of PR to autoinflammatory syndromes, we previously found that the dominant-active splice variant of the inflammasome adaptor protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (ASC), which lacks exon 2 (Δexon2), is expressed in Japanese patients with PR.
Elucidation of the mechanism of Δexon2 ASC production and the effect of IL-1β on splicing.
The genomic DNA of Japanese patients with PR was sequenced. The effect of the observed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on ASC splicing was determined via exon trapping using THP-1 cells stimulated with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) or ceramide. To investigate the genes that affect alternative splicing via IL-1β, we analyzed the transcriptome of IL-1β-treated THP-1 cells using RNA sequencing.
We found the rs8056505 A->G SNP located in the 5'-untranslated region of the genomic ASC gene in patients and that Δexon2 expression was induced by this SNP, whereas it was suppressed by IL-1β or ceramide. We detected 131,426 transcripts and identified 52 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) consisting of 41 downregulated genes and 11 upregulated genes in IL-1β-stimulated THP-1 cells. The splicing-related gene MASCRNA was the most significantly induced gene by IL-1β.
We propose a cyclic expression model in which ASC alternates between wild-type and Δexon2 expression regulated by the rs8056505 G allele and splicing factors induced by IL-1β. This cycle may be correlated with the formation of periodic PR pathologies."

To examine the diagnostic accuracy of ACR-1997, SLICC-2012, and EULAR/ACR-2019 for juvenile SLE.
A comprehensive search of PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase was conducted up to 26 March 2022.
We included all study designs in which patients had any index tests for ACR-1997, SLICC-2012, or EULAR/ACR-2019; both full-text papers and conference abstracts published in English were used. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) case reports; (2) adult subjects; or (3) did not report sufficient information to acquire true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative values of diagnostic criteria.
Two authors independently screened studies, extracted relevant data, and assessed the risk of bias.
First, a meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of EULAR/ACR-2019 and a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) model was performed to estimate sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We then carried out a network meta-analysis to compare the performances of these three diagnostic criteria.
In total, 17 relevant studies that included 2339 juvenile SLE patients were eligible to analyze pooled accuracy. In the meta-analysis, 10 studies (1613 cases) reported the diagnostic performance of EULAR/ACR-2019, showing a pooled sensitivity of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.89-0.95), pooled specificity of 0.89 (0.77-0.95), and area under HSROC of 0.96 (0.94-0.97). In the network meta-analysis, the SLICC-2012 (0.94, 0.92-0.96) had the highest sensitivity, followed by EULAR/ACR-2019 (0.93, 0.90-0.95), and ACR-1997 (0.78, 0.72-0.82); the ACR-1997 (0.96, 0.92-0.98) demonstrated the highest specificity. EULAR/ACR-2019 (0.92, 0.87-0.96) and SLICC-2012 (0.92, 0.86-0.96) had the similar specificity.

We aimed to investigate the immune cells and genes involved.
This was a single-center comparative study of 48 patients with seronegative PR and 48 healthy controls. Mass cytometry and RNA sequencing were used to identify distinct immune cell subsets in blood. Among the 48 seronegative PR patients, plasma samples from 40 patients were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for cytokine levels, and peripheral blood samples from 25 patients were evaluated by flow cytometry for mononuclear cell subsets. Plasma samples from 21 patients were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction for differential gene and protein expression, and samples from 3 patients were analyzed with whole-exome sequencing for gene mutations.
Immunophenotyping revealed a markedly increased frequency of CD14+CD11b+CD36+ and CD4+CD25-CD69+ cells in seronegative PR patients with active flares compared with healthy controls (P < 0.0001 for both cell subset comparisons). Gene enrichment analyses of RNA-sequencing data from sorted CD14+CD11b+CD36+ and CD4+CD25-CD69+ cells showed involvement of the inflammatory/stress response, phagocytosis, and regulation of apoptosis functional pathways. Up-regulated expression of CXCL16 and IL10RA was observed in monocytes from PR patients. Up-regulation of PFKFB3, DDIT4, and TGFB1, and down-regulation of PDIA6 were found in monocytes and lymphocytes from PR patients with active flares and PR patients in intercritical periods. Plasma levels of S100A8/A9 and interleukin-1β were elevated in PR patients. Whole-exome sequencing revealed novel polygenic mutations in HACL1, KDM5A, RASAL1, HAVCR2, PRDM9, MBOAT4, and JRKL.
In seronegative PR patients, we identified a distinct CD14+CD11b+CD36+ cell subset that can induce an inflammatory response under stress and exert antiinflammatory effects after phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, and a CD4+CD25-CD69+ T cell subset with pro- and antiinflammatory properties. Individuals with genetic mutations involving epigenetic modification, potentiation and resolution of stress-induced inflammation/apoptosis, and a dysregulated endoplasmic reticulum stress response could be predisposed to seronegative PR."

We reviewed the charts of 152 patients with diagnosis of PR. Inclusion criteria were diagnosis of PR according to the criteria of Weismann, age ≥16, active disease and treatment with MTX for at least 6 months. Disease outcome was assessed by reaching remission and prevention of disease evolution to chronic arthritis. Remission was defined as stopping the attacks for 12 weeks and prednisolone dose ≤5 mg/d. MTX treatment failure was defined as failure to achieve remission, the need to add other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and disease progression to chronic arthritis.
Fifty-nine patients were included in the study. Median duration of follow-up was 43 months. Attacks were controlled in 89.8% of patients. In 80% of the patients remission occurred during 12 months after starting treatment with MTX. Treatment failed in 20.3% of patients. Wrist joint involvement and positive rheumatoid factor (RF) were significantly more common in the MTX treatment-failed group. In RF positive patients evolution to rheumatoid arthritis was more common than in RF negative patients. No significant differences were observed in remission rate and evolution to rheumatoid arthritis in anticitrullinated C peptide positive and negative patients.

After PSM, we carried out a multivariate analysis with PR as the main outcome variable, ever smoking as the main predictor variable and age, gender, educational status, and marital status as covariates. PSM resulted in 123 PR patients and 246 matched controls. Multivariate analysis did not show a significant increase in the risk of PR in ever smokers. Seventy-six patients were anti-citrullinated protein/peptide antibody positive (ACPA-positive). Multivariate logistic regression showed a significant increase in the risk of PR in ACPA-positive ever smokers. Except lower sustained remission rate in ever smokers, no significant differences were observed in clinical manifestations and outcomes of PR between ever and never smokers.

The specific criteria items were highly variable in sensitivity (from 0.42% for delirium and 1.84% for psychosis to 75.6% for antibodies to double-stranded DNA), but their specificity was uniformly high, with low C3 or C4 (83.0%) and leucopenia <4.000/mm³ (83.8%) at the lowest end. Unexplained fever was 95.3% specific in this cohort. Applying the attribution rule improved specificity, particularly for joint involvement.
Changing the position of the highly sensitive, non-specific ANA to an entry criterion and the attribution rule resulted in a specificity of >80% for all items, explaining the higher overall specificity of the criteria set."

The TLAR convener designated an expert panel of 10 physicians experienced in hand OA for this process. The 2018 EULAR recommendations for the management of hand OA and the systematic review of the literature were sent to the expert panel via e-mails. The e-mail process which included Delphi round surveys was completed. The EULAR standard operational procedure Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II was followed. The level of agreement was calculated for each item and presented as mean, standard deviations, minimum and maximum and comparisons of 2018 EULAR recommendations were performed.
Five overarching principles and 10 recommendations were discussed. Revisions were held for the sixth, seventh, and ninth recommendations with lowest level of agreements. These recommendations were revised in accordance with suggestions from the experts and re-voted. The revised forms were approved despite the lack of statistically significant difference between these forms (p=0.400, p=0.451, p=0.496, respectively). Except for the ninth recommendation about surgery (p=0.008), no significant difference in level of agreements was observed between the EULAR and TLAR hand OA recommendations. The 11th recommendation about paraffin bath was added.
The optimal treatment of hand OA consists of personalized non-pharmacological (self-management, exercise, splint), pharmacological (topical non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as the first choice), and interventional procedures (only for refractory cases) based on shared decision between the patient and physician. TLAR hand OA recommendations were created mainly based on the most recent literature and the last EULAR hand OA management recommendations, which are widely approved among the TLAR experts."

All RFS children aged 2 to 19 years from the Juvenile Inflammatory Rheumatism cohort and followed at the French Reference Center for Autoinflammatory Diseases, Versailles Hospital, were included in our observational study. Immunisation status at ages 2, 7 and 15 years and at the last outpatient visit was evaluated according to the standard French vaccine schedule and recommended supplementary vaccines for patients with immunosuppressive therapy.
Of 200 patients, 90 (45%) had periodic fever, aphthous stomatitis, pharyngitis and adenitis syndrome; 52 (26%) had familial Mediterranean fever and 50 (25%) had undefined recurrent fever. Complete immunisation as per the standard schedule was obtained by 32% of patients at 2 years, 28% at 7 years, 6% at 15 years and 44% at the last outpatient visit. Similar or higher coverage was obtained by the last outpatient visit for most vaccines, compared to immunisation coverage at 2 years: pneumococcus (91% vs 88%), diphtheria tetanus poliomyelitis (82% vs 86%), hepatitis B (79% vs 69%) and measles, mumps, rubella (91% vs 50%). No patients with immunosuppressive therapy (n = 14) were up to date for all supplementary immunisations recommended for them.
Vaccination coverage for RFS children is suboptimal, especially for infants who present with recurrent febrile episodes. The initial vaccination delay is partially corrected through specialist follow-up in later years. Coverage according to the supplementary vaccine recommendations for immunosuppressed patients is poor. Key Points • Vaccination coverage for RFS children is suboptimal, especially at 2 years of age which is likely due to the prevalence of early recurrent febrile symptoms. • The initial vaccination delay is partially recovered during later follow-up at an expert rheumatology center. • Specific recommendations are particularly difficult to apply to patients on immunosuppressive therapy."

We performed a SLR using PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases. Three main aspects of PR were considered: treating flares, preventing recurrence of flares (i.e. achieving remission), and preventing progression to RA or to other persistent arthritis. Quality assessment of the studies was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS).
Twenty-seven articles met the inclusion criteria: 6 (22.2%) retrospective studies, 8 (29.6%) longitudinal studies, and 13 (48.1%) case series/case reports. No randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were found. Most of the studies (21/27, 77.7%) had a high risk of bias according to NOS. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were the most commonly reported treatments for flares of PR, with variable results. Anti-malarials, such as hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate, showed efficacy in reducing the frequency of the flares and, to a lesser extent, in preventing progression to RA. There was minimal evidence in support of other conventional/biological disease modifying anti-rheumatic treatments, or corticosteroids.
Although a frequent clinical dilemma for rheumatologists, the pharmacological management of PR has not been thoroughly evaluated, with no RCTs reported. Of all therapies, antimalarials have been the best studied and may be capable of reducing the recurrence of flares. The optimum treatment strategy for PR remains largely undefined and should be evaluated by robust RCTs in well-defined PR cohorts."

We assessed the incidence rate (IR) of PR in the population in the given year. After matching individuals with PR with those without PR (1:10) for age, gender, and the index year, we calculated the hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the Cox proportional hazard model.
A total of 19,724 newly diagnosed incident PR cases were identified from 2010 to 2016. The mean age was 50.2±14.9 years. The incidence of PR was 7.02 (95% CI 6.92-7.12) per 100,000 person-years (6.22 and 7.80 in men and women, respectively). During observation, 8.79% patients with PR and 0.30% individuals without PR developed various outcome diseases. Patients with PR had an increased risk of seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (HR 46.51, 95% CI [41.05-52.69]), psoriatic arthritis (44.79 [15.16-132.35]), systemic lupus erythematosus (24.53 [16.15-37.24]), mixed connective tissue disease (22.01 [7.65-63.34]), Behçet's disease (21.04 [13.81-32.06]), Sjögren's syndrome (12.36 [8.54-17.88]), ankylosing spondylitis (9.00 [6.67-12.15]), dermatomyositis/polymyositis (6.14 [2.55-14.82]), and systemic sclerosis (3.75 [1.47-9.58]) compared with individuals without PR.

A task force comprising of 25 rheumatologists from the 5 regions of the continent was formed and operated through a hub-and-spoke model with a central working committee (CWC) and 4 subgroups. The subgroups championed separate scopes of the clinical questions and formulated preliminary statements of recommendations which were processed centrally in the CWC. The CWC and each subgroup met by several virtual meetings, and two rounds of voting were conducted on the drafted statements of recommendations. Votes were online-delivered and recommendations were pruned down according to predefined criteria. Each statement was rated between 1 and 9 with 1-3, 4-6 and 7-9 representing disagreement, uncertainty and agreement, respectively. The levels of agreement on the statements were stratified as low, moderate or high according to the spread of votes. A statement was retired if it had a mean vote below 7 or a 'low' level of agreement.
A total of 126 initial statements of recommendations were drafted, and these were reduced to 22 after the two rounds of voting.
The preliminary statements of recommendations will serve to guide the clinical practice of rheumatology across Africa amidst the changing practices and uncertainties in the current era of COVID-19. It is recognized that further updates to the recommendations will be needed as more evidence emerges. Key Points • AFLAR has developed preliminary recommendations for the management of RMDs in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. • COVID-19 is an unprecedented experience which has brought new concerns regarding the use of some disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and these recommendations seek to provide guidelines to the African rheumatologists. • Hydroxychloroquine shortage has become rampart across Africa as the drug is being used as prophylaxis against COVID-19 and this may necessitate a review of treatment plan for some patients with RMDs. • Breastfeeding should continue for as long as possible if a woman is positive for SARS-CoV-2 as there is currently no evidence that the infection can be transmitted through breast milk."

The objective of this study is to evaluate the role of dermatoscopy as a further screening tool in RP.
Nailfold capillaries of RP patients were examined by a hand-held non-contact polarised dermatoscope connected to the digital camera (D1) and connected to an iPad (D2). Both dermatoscopic images were marked with an arrowhead. NVC examination was evaluated at the arrowhead. Single blinded reader performed all examinations. NVC was graded as per standard of European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) study group on microcirculation in rheumatic diseases. Consensus evaluation of dermatoscopy characteristics/grade was determined and each dermatoscopic image was given a final impression of 'normal', 'non-specific' or 'scleroderma' pattern. The final interpretation by both techniques was compared after completion of the blinded reading.
Classification of 100 consecutive dermatoscopic images resulted in 37 (wide view) 'non-interpretable', 2 'normal', 48 'non-specific' and 13 'scleroderma' pattern with D1; 23 'non-interpretable', 4 'normal', 52 'non-specific' and 21 'scleroderma' pattern by the experts with D2; 0 non-interpretable, 4 normal, 13 non-specific and 83 'scleroderma' pattern with NVC.
Overall, 50% of dermatoscopic images were classified as non-specific and 30% were classified as non-interpretable in RP patients. However, all images classified by dermatoscopy as ""normal"" or as overt ""scleroderma"" pattern were confirmed by concomitant NVC analysis. These findings demonstrate tenuous promise for dermatoscopy as a tool for the initial screening of nailfold capillaries in RP. Further regular work up with NVC is needed to further clarify non-interpretable and non-specific findings possibly related to non-scleroderma patterns."

In active proliferative LN, initial (induction) treatment with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF 2-3 g/day or mycophenolic acid (MPA) at equivalent dose) or low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide (CY; 500 mg × 6 biweekly doses), both combined with glucocorticoids (pulses of intravenous methylprednisolone, then oral prednisone 0.3-0.5 mg/kg/day) is recommended. MMF/CNI (especially tacrolimus) combination and high-dose CY are alternatives, for patients with nephrotic-range proteinuria and adverse prognostic factors. Subsequent long-term maintenance treatment with MMF or azathioprine should follow, with no or low-dose (<7.5 mg/day) glucocorticoids. The choice of agent depends on the initial regimen and plans for pregnancy. In non-responding disease, switch of induction regimens or rituximab are recommended. In pure membranous LN with nephrotic-range proteinuria or proteinuria >1 g/24 hours despite renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockade, MMF in combination with glucocorticoids is preferred. Assessment for kidney and extra-renal disease activity, and management of comorbidities is lifelong with repeat kidney biopsy in cases of incomplete response or nephritic flares. In ESKD, transplantation is the preferred kidney replacement option with immunosuppression guided by transplant protocols and/or extra-renal manifestations. Treatment of LN in children follows the same principles as adult disease.

Therapeutic patient education (TPE) is now recognized as a crucial tool in managing conditions like chronic inflammatory rheumatism and in improving treatment adherence. This study aimed to assess whether different TPE programs might improve adherence to subcutaneous anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) treatment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondyloarthritis (AS), and psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
This was a retrospective, observational, monocentric study of current care practices. We included 193 patients (124 women; mean age 53.3 ± 14.8 years). All patients received subcutaneous anti-TNF treatment and one of three TPE models, delivered by a nurse, from 2009 to 2013. The cohort was grouped according to different educational models: M1: information (N=92); M2: individual TPE (N=80); and M3: individual and group TPE sessions (N=21). Adherence was assessed with the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4™). Scores were rated as follows: good adherence (MMAS-4 = 4), moderate adherence (MMAS-4 = 2-3), and poor adherence (MMAS-4 = 0-1).
The mean disease duration was 10 years [95% CI: 5 to 18]. The cohort comprised 113 patients with RA, 73 with AS, and seven with PsA. Overall, 146 (75.7%) patients displayed good adherence, 34 (17.6%) displayed moderate adherence, and 13 (6.7%) displayed poor adherence. The M3 group displayed less adherence than the M1 and M2 groups. Old age was the only factor correlated with good adherence (p=0.005). The level of knowledge had no significant impact on adherence.
This study demonstrated good adherence to anti-TNF treatment in patients that received TPE, particularly when it was delivered in individual sessions."

This study applied the new criteria schema to a tertiary center SLE cohort, ascertained its performance, and identified the clinical characteristics of patients who did not fulfill these criteria. From the 217 patients who were included, 11 (5%) did not meet the new criteria, mainly because of the antinuclear antibody entry criterion, resulting in a diagnostic sensitivity of 94%. Within this group, we found that constitutional and renal manifestations were unusual. Additionally, specific SLE antibodies as well as hypocomplementemia were less likely to be present. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in outcomes between the two groups of patients (fulfilling vs. unfulfilling the new criteria). We conclude that the EULAR/ACR criteria may misclassify a small subset of SLE patients with milder disease. It is important to be cognizant of key clinical and serologic features of these patients and treat them accordingly to prevent further irreversible damage."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical characteristics of and autoinflammatory syndrome-associated gene polymorphisms in patients with PR and IH and to identify predictive factors for developing other rheumatic diseases.
Six PR patients (four females; median age at disease onset, 20.0 years; median age at evaluation, 47.0 years) were retrospectively evaluated for clinical features and polymorphisms in genes responsible for autoinflammatory diseases.
All six patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for PR and showed clinical feature of IH. Two presented with recurrent fever. All six patients were negative for rheumatoid factor and ACPA and had normal articular X-ray findings. Among the six patients, MEFV gene polymorphisms known to cause FMF were identified in four, CIAS1 mutation was observed in one, and TNFRSFIA mutation was observed in one. Colchicine was effective in three patients with MEFV polymorphisms. The other five patients continued to experience PR, although three patients achieved remission with medication.

Three patients (4.2%) with probable PM were newly reclassified as non-IIM due to a total score of 5.3 or smaller. Meanwhile, one patient with possible PM was newly reclassified as probable PM due to the presence of dysphagia. In addition, eight patients (16.3%) with possible DM with DM-specific typical skin rash were newly reclassified as amyopathic DM (ADM) due to the absence of proximal muscle weakness. The concordance rate of the classification between the Bohan and Peter criteria and the 2017 EULAR/ACR criteria was 95.8% for PM patients and 83.7% for DM patients.
The Bohan and Peter criteria were comparable to the 2017 EULAR/ ACR criteria for classifying PM and DM in Korean patients. Considering the convenience of the Bohan and Peter criteria in the real clinical settings, we suggest that the old criteria should be preferentially applied and then performing muscle biopsy should be considered in a patient suspected of PM without antihistidyl tRNA synthetase (anti-Jo-1).

In 2012, the Systemic Lupus International Collaborating Clinics (SLICC) criteria were published in an attempt to improve the clinical relevance of SLE criteria. In 2017, weighted criteria were proposed that included entry criteria, something the 1997 ACR and the 2012 SLICC criteria did not identify. The aim of the present study was to validate the 2017 weighted criteria, the 1997 ACR criteria, and the 2012 SLICC criteria and compare the sensitivities and specificities in pediatric SLE.
For the past 15 years, retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with SLE before age 19 years was conducted. The controls were patients referred for serologies positive for antinuclear antibodies but did not fulfill criteria for diagnosis of SLE at the initial visit or were diagnosed with another autoimmune disease. The 3 classification criteria sets were applied to these patients and compared against a gold standard of physician diagnosis.
A total of 156 patients were diagnosed with SLE. The sensitivity for the 2017 weighted criteria was 0.974 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.936-0.993) and the specificity was 0.984 (95% CI 0.966-0.994). The sensitivity for the 1997 ACR criteria was 0.872 (95% CI 0.809-0.920) and the specificity was 1.00 (95% CI 0.990-1.000). The sensitivity for the 2012 SLICC criteria was 0.974 (95% CI 0.936-0.993) and the specificity was 0.997 (95% CI 0.985-1.000).
The 2017 weighted criteria and the 2012 SLICC criteria were more sensitive than the 1997 ACR criteria. There were no significant differences in sensitivity and specificity between the 2012 SLICC and the 2017 weighted criteria."

Although the pathogenesis of PR is still unclear, the clinical condition is similar to that of autoinflammatory diseases caused by dysregulation of inflammasome-related genes.
We analyzed the inflammasome adapter PYD and CARD domain-containing protein/apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD (PYCARD/ASC) in Japanese patients with PR.
Serum interleukin (IL)-1β concentrations in three Japanese patients with PR were measured. We also cloned PYCARD/ASC cDNA variants and expressed them in THP-1 cells to determine their effects on inflammasome activity following stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and monosodium urate. Lysates of recombinant THP-1 cells were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation assays.
Serum IL-1β concentrations were significantly elevated in patients with PR, and a splice variant of PYCARD/ ASC mRNA lacking exon 2 (Δexon2) was dominantly expressed compared with that in controls. Moreover, IL-1β secretion was significantly increased in THP-1 cells expressing Δexon2PYCARD/ASC compared with that in cells expressing the wild-type protein. The amount of NLRP3 bound to Δexon2PYCARD/ASC was increased after stimulation, whereas that bound to the wild-type protein was decreased. There were no differences in caspase-1 binding.
Δexon2 PYCARD/ASC was associated with the pathogenesis of PR."

To date, there are no recommendations for the standardized control of glucocorticoid treatment in such situations.
Based on a literature search this paper provides an overview of evidence-based and eminence-based recommendations for the control of glucocorticoid treatment under intensive care conditions using the example of systemic lupus erythematosus.
A systematic literature search was carried out using a MeSH term search in the PubMed database.
Infections are one of the most common causes for the treatment of patients with rheumatic diseases in intensive care units. In the case of systemic lupus erythematosus it is particularly challenging to distinguish the infection from increased disease activity or to treat the parallel occurrence. Patients in an intensive care unit are exposed to an increased level of physical stress due to the severity of the disease, which is why special attention should be paid to symptoms of adrenocortical insufficiency. Evidence-based recommendations for prophylaxis of an adrenal crisis only exist in relation to perioperative procedures and not for the situation of severe infections.
The use of glucocorticoids in systemic lupus erythematosus is often chronic and there is an increased risk of infections. In the case of infections (or simultaneous disease flare) adequate anti-infective treatment should be administered, the treatment with glucocorticoids should be adjusted accordingly and symptoms of adrenocortical insufficiency should simultaneously be looked for."

Therefore, the center regularly receives the VRA seal for quality of care. In 2018 more than 7500 patients were treated as inpatients. Within the framework of care according to §116b (ASV since May 2019) there were nearly 25,000 outpatient patient contacts. Furthermore, an early screening program (triage) was established 5 years ago in order to be able to identify patients with musculoskeletal complaints on a potentially inflammatory rheumatic basis. This functions in the sense of an early diagnosis and treatment in accordance with the treat-to-target concept within less than 4 weeks (initially) on an outpatient basis with respect to the required urgency, in order to subsequently provide sound diagnostic support. In the last 2 years 2017 and 2018, this deadline was met in more than 90% of cases. Within the scope of inpatient care approximately one third of patients were treated in recent years with a defined rheumatological complex therapy and 10% with pain complex therapy. Approximately 3% were treated with geriatric complex therapy and 65% were short-stay patients (<4 days), i.e. patients who received the necessary diagnostics and treatment on an inpatient basis at short notice. The overall structure of the rheumatism center, the cooperation with rheumatologists in private practice, many cooperation partners, referring physicians and patients represents a model for rheumatological care in large conurbations.

Included were consecutive patients with complete data on all ACR/EULAR items (n = 243) who underwent SGUS in our primary Sjögren's syndrome expertise center. Clinical diagnosis by the treating physician was used as the gold standard. Separate analyses were performed for patients who underwent labial or parotid gland biopsies. The average score for hypoechogenic areas in 1 parotid and 1 submandibular gland was determined (range 0-3). Next, performance of the ACR/EULAR criteria was evaluated after addition of SGUS or replacement of current items by SGUS.
Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed an optimal cutoff value of ≥1.5 for SGUS. The optimal weight for SGUS positivity was 1. Cutoff for ACR/EULAR fulfilment remained ≥4. In patients who underwent a labial gland biopsy (n = 124), the original criteria showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.965, sensitivity of 95.9%, and specificity of 92.2%. After the addition of SGUS, the AUC was 0.966, with a sensitivity of 97.3% and specificity of 90.2%. In patients who underwent a parotid gland biopsy (n = 198), similar results were found. Sensitivity of the criteria decreased substantially when SGUS replaced salivary gland biopsy or anti-SSA antibodies, while performance remained equal when SGUS replaced the ocular staining score, Schirmer's test, or unstimulated whole saliva flow.
Validity of the ACR/EULAR criteria remains high after incorporation of SGUS. With SGUS, clinicians are offered a larger array of tests to evaluate fulfillment of the ACR/EULAR criteria."

Recommendations were formulated using a Delphi consensus approach. Eight key recommendations were generated. A search for crystals in synovial fluid or tophus aspirates is recommended in every person with suspected gout, because demonstration of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals allows a definite diagnosis of gout. There was consensus that a number of suggestive clinical features support a clinical diagnosis of gout. These are monoarticular involvement of a foot or ankle joint (especially the first metatarsophalangeal joint); previous episodes of similar acute arthritis; rapid onset of severe pain and swelling; erythema; male gender and associated cardiovascular diseases and hyperuricaemia. When crystal identification is not possible, it is recommended that any atypical presentation should be investigated by imaging, in particular with ultrasound to seek features suggestive of MSU crystal deposition (double contour sign and tophi). There was consensus that a diagnosis of gout should not be based on the presence of hyperuricaemia alone. There was also a strong recommendation that all people with gout should be systematically assessed for presence of associated comorbidities and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, as well as for risk factors for chronic hyperuricaemia.

Increasing international travel (for social, leisure, and business) between Oman and several chikungunya endemic countries including Pakistan may facilitate the introduction of chikungunya to Oman. We report the first imported case of chikungunya in an Omani traveler with a link to the current outbreak in Pakistan."

Afterwards, each recommendation was brought forward for discussion and any alteration gaining ≥70% approval was accepted. Also, Turkish version of each item was rearranged. Last version of the recommendations was then revoted to determine the level of agreement. Levels of agreement of the two voting rounds were compared with Wilcoxon signed-rank test. In case of significant difference, the item with higher level of agreement was accepted. In case of no difference, the changed item was selected.
Four overarching principles and 12 recommendations were assessed among which three overarching principles and one recommendation were changed. The changed overarching principles emphasized the importance of physical medicine and rehabilitation specialists as well as rheumatologists for the care of RA patients in Turkey. An alteration was made in the eighth recommendation on treatment of active RA patients with unfavorable prognostic indicators after failure of three conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Remaining principles were accepted as the same although some alterations were suggested but could not find adequate support to reach significance.

Adults with newly diagnosed IIM attending Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust were identified over a 10 year period. A retrospective review of all putative cases was performed and those fulfilling a consensus expert opinion diagnosis of IIM were included. Clinical, serological and histological data were collected and each case was assigned a single IIM subtype. The EULAR/ACR classification criteria were then applied and sensitivity, specificity and positive and negative predictive values were calculated, presented with 95% CIs.
A total of 1637 cases were screened, with 255 consensus expert opinion IIM cases ultimately identified. Applying the EULAR/ACR classification criteria, the sensitivity to diagnose an IIM was 99.6% (95% CI 97.2, 100) and 80.9% (95% CI 76.0, 85.8) for the criteria cut-points of probable and definite diagnoses, respectively. In 94/255 cases the IIM subtype differed between consensus expert opinion and classification criteria, most strikingly in the group subtyped as PM by the EULAR/ACR criteria, where there was discrepancy in the majority (i.e. in 87/161).
The EULAR/ACR criteria performed with high sensitivity in identifying IIM in this external cohort of incident IIM. However, substantial disagreements arose between consensus expert opinion and the criteria regarding IIM subtype assignments, resulting in a large proportion of criteria-assigned cases of PM having heterogeneous features. These results may have important implications for future use of these criteria in subsequent research."

The sequelae of involvement of the cervical spine are craniocervical and atlantoaxial instability, which can cause severe pain, neural deficits and even death. Multimodal conservative treatment can lead to an alleviation of pain but in cases of therapy-resistant pain or neural deficits surgical treatment alone is essential to improve patient outcome.

For comparison, the same US assessment was also performed in anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) positive individuals with musculoskeletal symptoms (CCP+ at risk) and patients with NORA.
Thirty-one of 79 patients with PR recruited were assessed during a flare. A high frequency of ECI was identified on US; 19/31 (61%) of patients had ECI including 12/19 (63%) in whom ECI was identified in the absence of synovitis. Only 7/31 (23%) patients with PR had synovitis (greyscale ≥1 and power Doppler ≥1) during flare. In the hands/wrists, ECI was more prevalent in PR compared with NORA and CCP+ at risk (65% vs 29 % vs 6%, p<0.05). Furthermore, ECI without synovitis was specific for PR (42% PR vs 4% NORA (p=0.003) and 6% CCP+ at risk (p=0.0012)). Eleven PR flares were captured by MRI, which was more sensitive than US for synovitis and ECI. 8/31 (26%) patients with PR developed RA and had a similar US phenotype to NORA at progression.
PR has a distinct US pattern characterised by reversible ECI, often without synovitis. In patients presenting with new joint swelling, US may refine management by distinguishing relapsing from persistent arthritis."

An interdisciplinary group of experts developed and approved a prototype of the rheumatism and sports compass (Rheuma und Sport Kompass, RSK) based on the literature and own experience. They considered individual health factors and biomechanics of sports functions. The prototype was tested, revised and reconsidered in an interim evaluation. The resulting RSKv1 was evaluated in a clinical observation phase with 61 patients. The results were subsequently incorporated into the final version of RSK during an interdisciplinary decision-making process. This was verified in a feasibility study with a follow-up survey of rheumatic patients with a RSK partial participation certification for physical education including: clinical assessment during 8 lessons of physical education and after 8 lessons of physical education. Teachers rated the RSK online after 8 lessons. The evaluation was descriptive and differences in mean values were tested.
In this study 50 patients and 31 teachers were evaluated. The affliction of pain decreased in terms of frequency, amount and duration after physical education with RSK. No worsening in health was reported after participation in sports. The teachers rated the RSK as understandable, practicable and they felt confident to allow the patients to participate in classes. The RSK was rated significantly better than a standard certification text. With the RSK, patients can be advised to safely take part in physical education."

We investigated the relationships between CHIKV exposure, long-lasting rheumatic musculoskeletal pain (LRMSP) and chronic fatigue. 1094 participants (512 CHIKV seropositive and 582 seronegative) of the TELECHIK population-based cohort were analysed considering the duration of the manifestations throughout an average 2-year follow-up. Weighted prevalence rates and prevalence ratios for LRMSP, idiopathic chronic fatigue (ICF), and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)-like illness, both latter syndromes adapted from Centers for Disease Control (CDC)-1994/Fukuda criteria, were compared. Population attributable fractions (PAF) were estimated to assess the contribution of CHIKV infection to each of the three phenotypes. Among 362 adult subjects who had reported either rheumatic pain or fatigue at the onset of the infection, weighted prevalence rates of LRMSP, ICF and CFS-like illness were respectively of 32.9%, 38.7% and 23.9%, and of 8.7%, 8.5% and 7.4% among initially asymptomatic peers (P < 0.01, respectively). Each of the three outcomes was highly attributable to chikungunya (PAF of 43.2%, 36.2% and 41.0%, respectively). In the sub-cohort of CHIKV-infected subjects, LRMSP, ICF and CFS-like illness, which overlapped in 70%, accounted for 53% of the chronic manifestations. In addition to rheumatic disease, chronic fatigue could be considered in caring for patients with chronic chikungunya disease."

Palindromic rheumatism is well-characterized in adults, but has never been reported in pediatric populations. The aim of this study was to characterize the clinical features and outcomes of a series of pediatric patients with palindromic rheumatism.
We defined clinical criteria for palindromic rheumatism and reviewed all clinical visits in three Pediatric Rheumatology centers in Israel from 2006through 2015, to identify patients with the disease. We collected retrospective clinical and laboratory data on patients who fulfilled the criteria, and reviewed their medical records in order to determine the proportion of patients who had developed juvenile idiopathic arthritis.
Overall, 10 patients were identified. Their mean age at diagnosis was 8.3 ± 4.5 years and the average follow-up was 3.8 ± 2.7 years. The mean duration of attacks was 12.2 ± 8.4 days. The most frequently involved joints were knees. Patients tested positive for rheumatoid factor in 20% of cases. One patient developed polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis after three years of follow-up, six patients (60%) continued to have attacks at their last follow-up and only three children (30%) achieved long-term remission.
Progression to juvenile idiopathic arthritis is rare amongst children with palindromic rheumatism and most patients continued to have attacks at their last follow-up. Longer follow-up periods are required to predict the long-term outcomes of pediatric patients with palindromic rheumatism."

This study evaluated the concordance between the International League Against Rheumatism (ILAR) criteria for systemic JIA and the Yamaguchi criteria and then compared their possible prognostic value in patients with AOSD.
In a retrospective review of 169 adults with suspected AOSD, patients were classified according to the Yamaguchi or ILAR criteria. Then the concordance in cross-referencing the other group with the different criteria was investigated and the sensitivity and specificity of each set of criteria were determined. Disease activity markers in AOSD patients were correlated with positivity according to both systems.
Concordance was good in patients with suspected AOSD (k = 0.7144, p <  0.001) and low in those with a diagnosis of AOSD (k = 0.3787, p <  0.001). The sensitivity of the ILAR criteria in AOSD patients was 0.8864 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.8322-0.9405), and the specificity was 0.7838 (0.6511, 0.9164). Positivity according to the ILAR criteria correlated with the systemic score (r = 0.763, p <  0.0001) and C-reactive protein levels (r = 0.183, p = 0.0356) and was associated with a relapse (odds ratio: 1.589, 95% CI: 1.043-2.421), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS; odds ratio: 1.993, 95% CI: 1.218-3.263) and care in the intensive care unit (ICU; odds ratio: 2.087, 95% CI: 1.086-4.011).
In AOSD patients, there is fair concordance between the Yamaguchi and ILAR criteria for systemic JIA. Positive ILAR criteria may be useful for identifying AOSD patients at high risk for relapse, MAS and the need for ICU care. Further studies including larger populations from several centers are needed to confirm our results regarding the utility of the ILAR criteria in AOSD patients."

Many traditional Chinese drugs have been used for a long time to treat rheumatism. However, a comprehensive information source for these drugs is still missing, and their anti-rheumatism mechanisms remain unclear. An ontology for anti-rheumatism traditional Chinese drugs would strongly support the representation, analysis, and understanding of these drugs.
In this study, we first systematically collected reported information about 26 traditional Chinese decoction pieces drugs, including their chemical ingredients and adverse events (AEs). By mostly reusing terms from existing ontologies (e.g., TCMDPO for traditional Chinese medicines, NCBITaxon for taxonomy, ChEBI for chemical elements, and OAE for adverse events) and making semantic axioms linking different entities, we developed the Ontology of Chinese Medicine for Rheumatism (OCMR) that includes over 3000 class terms. Our OCMR analysis found that these 26 traditional Chinese decoction pieces are made from anatomic entities (e.g., root and stem) from 3 Bilateria animals and 23 Mesangiospermae plants. Anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic roles are important for anti-rheumatism drugs. Using the total of 555 unique ChEBI chemical entities identified from these drugs, our ChEBI-based classification analysis identified 18 anti-inflammatory, 33 antineoplastic chemicals, and 9 chemicals (including 3 diterpenoids and 3 triterpenoids) having both anti-inflammatory and antineoplastic roles. Furthermore, our study detected 22 diterpenoids and 23 triterpenoids, including 16 pentacyclic triterpenoids that are likely bioactive against rheumatism. Six drugs were found to be associated with 184 unique AEs, including three AEs (i.e., dizziness, nausea and vomiting, and anorexia) each associated with 5 drugs. Several chemical entities are classified as neurotoxins (e.g., diethyl phthalate) and allergens (e.g., eugenol), which may explain the formation of some TCD AEs. The OCMR could be efficiently queried for useful information using SPARQL scripts.
The OCMR ontology was developed to systematically represent 26 traditional anti-rheumatism Chinese drugs and their related information. The OCMR analysis identified possible anti-rheumatism and AE mechanisms of these drugs. Our novel ontology-based approach can also be applied to systematic representation and analysis of other traditional Chinese drugs."

The paw swelling and arthritic scores were relieved, and the variation of relative body weight and mechanical nociceptive threshold had improved in the AIA rats. The serum levels of RF, MDA, ALP, AST, and ALT were alleviated, and the inflammation and cartilage damage were effectively attenuated in the AIA rats. Simultaneously, the inflammation of the synovial cavity was alleviated, and the grading of synovitis reduced by inhibiting the expressions of IL-1

An association between PR and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has long been postulated; a significant proportion of PR patients eventually develop RA and the majority also have anti-CCP antibodies. Therefore, PR is often considered a prodrome of RA. However, the clinical and imaging phenotype of PR has several important distinctions from RA. This suggests that despite the similarities, distinct disease mechanisms are at play. Given the paucity of evidence-based therapy in PR, a better understanding of these mechanisms will be important for refined and targeted therapeutic approaches for this important condition."

After adjusting for comorbid diabetes mellitus, we estimated the odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using conditional logistic regression analysis to quantify the association between a history of PD and the risk of PR. The influences of the lag time and severity of PD were examined by calculating ORs for subgroups of patients based on the time interval between the last PD-related visit and the index date and PD-related cumulative cost and number of visit.
This study showed an association between a history of PD and incident PR (OR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.41-1.61). The association remained significant after variation of PD definitions. The magnitude of the association was greater in those with shorter lag time between the latest date of PD diagnosis and PR index date and those who had a higher number of visits for PD or a greater cumulative cost for PD-related visits. After excluding 569 PR patients who developed rheumatoid arthritis after the index date, we found a consistent time- and dose-dependent association between PD and PR risk.

The 2010 ACR/European League against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were thus formulated to recognize the early stage of disease with high sensitivity. This pilot study was designed to estimate and compare the sensitivities of the 1987 ACR and 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA.
In a tertiary care hospital, the medical records of 97 patients diagnosed with RA were reviewed. Case study forms were filled with relevant clinical data and investigation results after reviewing each medical record. The radiographs of hands were also reviewed. To each case, both the 1987 ACR and the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria were applied and the results of the classification were noted.
The sensitivity of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria was found to be 79.38 per cent [95% confidence interval (CI) = 71.33-87.43%] and the sensitivity of the 1987 ACR criteria was found to be 63.92 per cent (95% CI = 54.36-73.48%). The difference in the sensitivities was significant (P< 0.01). There was a significant rise in sensitivity of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria when patients having anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) titres were analysed.
The 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria were found to be more sensitive than the 1987 ACR criteria possibly owing to features of the criteria. Anti-CCP titres were found to increase the sensitivity of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria."

Full-text publication rate, the elapsed time between presentation and full-text publication, type of the disease in the studies, distribution of abstracts and full-texts according to countries, journals, and presentation types were investigated.
Totally 220 abstracts were detected related to pediatric rheumatology. Twenty-two of them had only the title, authors' names, and institution of origin, but no abstract. Therefore, a total number of 198 abstracts were evaluated. Eighty-six (43.4%) abstracts were found to be accepted as full-text articles. The elapsed time between presentation and full text publication was median 19 months (range 0 to 64 months). While 12 orally presented abstracts (34%) became full-text articles, this rate was 45% (74 abstracts) for poster presentations. There was no significant difference in the elapsed time to reach full-text publication and impact factors between presentation types (p=0.832 and p=0.053, respectively).

Patients clinically diagnosed with SSc between September 2013 and May 2015 were prospectively recruited from the EUSTAR database of the Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Diagnosis of SSc was based on the evaluation of three experienced rheumatologists. Patients diagnosed with other connective tissue diseases were recruited as disease controls. The 1980 ACR and 2013 ACR/EULAR criteria were applied to the cohort, and patients who fulfilled the criteria were classified as definite SSc patients. Sensitivity and specificity were analyzed for the 2013 and 1980 criteria.
A total of 143 SSc patients and 87 patients with other connective diseases were recruited. 41 (28.7%) and 102 (71.3%) cases were diffuse cutaneous SSc and limited cutaneous SSc, respectively. Although the sensitivity of the 2013 criteria (94.4%) exceeded the 1980 criteria (72.7%) (P<0.001), the 1980 and 2013 criteria sets showed no significant difference in specificity (97.7% and 93.1%, respectively, P = 0.278). The sensitivity of the 2013 criteria was significantly higher than the 1980 criteria in some SSc subgroups (e.g., lcSSc, abnormal pattern of nailfold videocapillaroscopy [NVC] and presence of Raynaud's phenomenon [RP]) compared to others.

The presence of remission according to American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and other criteria (Boolean clinical, Clinical Disease Activity Index, Disease Activity Score [DAS], DAS in 28 joints, and Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3) was assessed in early RA patients during the first year of the Combination Therapy for Rheumatoid Arthritis light trial. Likelihood ratios were used to assess whether meeting the remission criteria at single visits (13, 26, 39, or 52 weeks) and consecutive visits (13 and 26, 26 and 39, or 39 and 52 weeks) predicted good outcome in the second year (52-104 weeks). Good outcome was defined for function (Health Assessment Questionnaire score consistently ≤0.5 and no deterioration), radiographic damage progression (no deterioration in Sharp/van der Heijde scores), and both (""overall good outcome"").
Of the original 164 trial patients, 144 had evaluable data. In the second year, good functional outcome was observed in 35%, good radiographic outcome in 79%, and both in 28% of the patients. Almost all criteria predicted good functional and good overall outcome, at both single and consecutive visits; only single DAS remission did not significantly predict good overall outcome (P = 0.07). Sustained remission periods resulted in higher likelihood ratios than remission at single visits. None of the criteria predicted good radiographic outcome.
Early RA patients who reached remission according to ACR/EULAR and other criteria during short or sustained periods were likely to retain good physical function in the subsequent months. Sustained remission periods were a stronger predictor than remission at single visits. However, in the setting of low overall damage progression, (sustained) remission was not predictive of good radiographic outcome."

We undertook this study to compare definitions of remission to inform choice of end points for future rheumatoid arthritis (RA) clinical trials, and we also included in our comparison the remission criterion of a score of ≤2.8 on the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI).
We performed post hoc analyses on clinical remission rates using data from 2 infliximab trials (the ASPIRE [Active-Controlled Study of Patients Receiving Infliximab for the Treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis of Early Onset] and ATTRACT [Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Trial in Rheumatoid Arthritis with Concomitant Therapy] trials) and 1 golimumab trial (the GO-FORWARD trial). We investigated stringency of the different remission definitions, their power to discriminate between active drug and comparator, and aspects of their internal and external validity. We also investigated population determinants of discriminatory power for a particular remission end point.
In patients with early RA (the ASPIRE trial), ACR/EULAR Boolean, CDAI, and SDAI remission rates at 6-7 months were 4-6% for methotrexate (MTX) alone versus 11-14% for infliximab plus MTX. In patients with MTX-refractory active RA (the ATTRACT and GO-FORWARD trials), remission rates were ≤1% for comparator (add-on of placebo) versus 4-6% for add-on of infliximab in the ATTRACT trial and ≤3% for comparator (add-on of placebo) versus 11-13% for add-on of golimumab in the GO-FORWARD trial. Existing remission cut points of different measures were generally comparable, with the Boolean criteria being somewhat more stringent than the SDAI and CDAI criteria. Remission rates were similar across definitions, as was average statistical power (CDAI, 55.6%; Boolean, 59.9%; SDAI, 62.6%).
Remission is an ambitious primary end point for RA clinical trials, to be reserved for selected scenarios based on power considerations. The ACR/EULAR definitions are interchangeable, with slightly higher stringency of Boolean criteria over index-based criteria."

Kappa statistics were used to evaluate the agreement between the EULAR (moderate or good response) and SDAI50 RMs. The RMs at 3 months were also compared for their ability to predict low disease activity state (LDAS) or remission (REM) at 6 months.
A total of 1,124 patients were evaluated. Of those, 215 patients (30%) and 294 patients (45%) failed to achieve a EULAR and SDAI50 response, respectively. There was a good agreement between EULAR and SDAI50 RMs with a kappa of 0.59 (95% confidence interval 0.53-0.66). Throughout the range of disease activity, the SDAI50 response was shown to be more stringent than the EULAR response. Multivariable linear regression analysis demonstrated that both RMs at 3 months were associated with LDAS or REM at 6 months, and SDAI50 had a more significant impact on this outcome compared to the EULAR response.
There is a good agreement between the EULAR and SDAI50 RMs. Although a minority of patients have discordant RMs at each end of the disease activity spectrum at baseline, the SDAI50 response at 3 months appears to be a more significant predictor of outcomes at 6 months than EULAR response."

Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are a principal strategy to improve outcomes. To provide best practices in the diagnosis and management of patients with RA, the Thai Rheumatism Association (TRA) developed scientifically sound and clinically relevant evidence-based recommendations for general practitioners, internists, orthopedists, and physiatrists.
Thirty-seven rheumatologists from across Thailand formulated 18 clinically relevant questions: three for diagnosis, 10 for treatments, four for monitoring, and one for referral. A bibliographic team systematically reviewed the relevant literature on these topics up to December 2013. A set of recommendations was proposed based on the results of systematic reviews combined with expert opinions. Group consensus was achieved for all statements and recommendations using the nominal group technique.
A set of recommendations was proposed. For diagnosis, either American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1987 or ACR/European League Against Rheumatism 2010 classification criteria can be applied. For treatment, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoid, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including antimalarials, methotrexate and sulfasalazine are recommended. Physiotherapy should be suggested to all patients. Tight control strategy and monitoring for efficacy and side effects of treatments, as well as indications for referral to a rheumatologist are provided.

The work performed by the German Rheumatism Research Center (DRFZ) and the Association of Rheumatological Acute Clinics (VRA) in Germany has already used certain quality indicators and this topic has been recently described elsewhere. International quality indicators have also been published in recent years, all for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the most prevalent inflammatory rheumatic disease and are the central subject of this article. This overview of proposed instruments for quality assessment in rheumatology is intended to initiate a broad discussion on the subject of quality of rheumatological care in Germany."

The 428 profiles comprised 161 patients with systemic JIA-associated MAS and 267 patients with a condition that could potentially be confused with MAS (active systemic JIA without evidence of MAS, or systemic infection). Next, the ability of candidate criteria to classify individual patients as having MAS or not having MAS was assessed by evaluating the agreement between the classification yielded using the criteria and the consensus classification of the experts. The final criteria were selected in a consensus conference. Experts achieved consensus on the classification of 391 of the 428 patient profiles (91.4%). A total of 982 candidate criteria were tested statistically. The 37 best-performing criteria and 8 criteria obtained from the literature were evaluated at the consensus conference. During the conference, 82% consensus among experts was reached on the final MAS classification criteria. In validation analyses, these criteria had a sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.99. Agreement between the classification (MAS or not MAS) obtained using the criteria and the original diagnosis made by the treating physician was high (κ=0.76). We have developed a set of classification criteria for MAS complicating systemic JIA and provided preliminary evidence of its validity.

The objective was to update these recommendations.
A systematic literature review was performed regarding pharmacological treatment in PsA. Subsequently, recommendations were formulated based on the evidence and the expert opinion of the 34 Task Force members. Levels of evidence and strengths of recommendations were allocated.
The updated recommendations comprise 5 overarching principles and 10 recommendations, covering pharmacological therapies for PsA from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), to conventional synthetic (csDMARD) and biological (bDMARD) disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, whatever their mode of action, taking articular and extra-articular manifestations of PsA into account, but focusing on musculoskeletal involvement. The overarching principles address the need for shared decision-making and treatment objectives. The recommendations address csDMARDs as an initial therapy after failure of NSAIDs and local therapy for active disease, followed, if necessary, by a bDMARD or a targeted synthetic DMARD (tsDMARD). The first bDMARD would usually be a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. bDMARDs targeting interleukin (IL)12/23 (ustekinumab) or IL-17 pathways (secukinumab) may be used in patients for whom TNF inhibitors are inappropriate and a tsDMARD such as a phosphodiesterase 4-inhibitor (apremilast) if bDMARDs are inappropriate. If the first bDMARD strategy fails, any other bDMARD or tsDMARD may be used.
These recommendations provide stakeholders with an updated consensus on the pharmacological treatment of PsA and strategies to reach optimal outcomes in PsA, based on a combination of evidence and expert opinion."
182,26548003,2015-11-10,[Update rheumatism focusing on rheumatoid arthritis].,N/A,Rheumatic diseases do not only represent a challenge in day to day clinical medicine but also during underwriting and claims handling in insurance medicine. New diagnostic laboratory tests and therapeutic options constantly improve diagnostic quality and treatment outcomes. Using rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as an example this article explains how this new aspects found their way into international diagnostic criteria and treatment guidelines. The introduction of diagnostic ACPAs (Anti-Citrullinated Protein Antibodies) and the therapeutic use of currently still relatively expensive biologicals have to be highlighted in this respect. Backed by modern therapeutic options recent RA morbidity figures of employed persons indicate a shift to less severe morbidity spectra. For individual case evaluation it is of importance to understand the most relevant aspects of such innovations for adequate and sound case assessment in underwriting and claims.

A systematic literature review was conducted using Ovid Medline, Embase, PubMed, CINAHL, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library (1970 through April 2014). Quality of evidence (QoE) of identified studies was appraised by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) (interventions) and the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) methodologies (prognostic factors). Out of 10 931 titles identified, 52 articles were finally selected. A single study indicated that an initial prednisone dose of 20 mg/day is associated with a lower short-term relapse rate than 10 mg/day but at the cost of a higher rate of adverse events. Another study suggested a comparable efficacy of intramuscular methylprednisolone and oral glucocorticoids (GCs) with lower cumulative GC doses and less weight gain in the former group. Moderate to high QoE (1-2 studies) indicated a benefit of methotrexate in remission rates and cumulative GC doses in early PMR. Anti-tumour necrosis factor α agents are ineffective for PMR treatment. Among prognostic factors, female sex, high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and peripheral arthritis were associated in some studies with a higher relapse risk. Women and patients with high ESR also appeared to have a longer duration of treatment. Several studies of varying quality, however, failed to prove these associations. In PMR, evidence for initial GC doses and subsequent tapering regimens is limited. Intramuscular methylprednisolone and methotrexate may be effective GC sparing agents. Female sex, high ESR and peripheral arthritis at disease outset are potential risk factors for a worse prognosis."

Based on those non-weighted values, it is difficult to estimate which would be the expected number of patients with CHIK who will develop CIR. For these reasons, we modeled weighted estimations based on pooled data extracted from those eight representative studies in order to provide cumulative proportion of pCHIK-CIR over time and median time of it, but also estimations of the number of patients with CHIK reported in Latin American countries (within a 95 % CI). This model estimated a prevalence of 47.57 % for pCHIK-CIR (95 % CI 45.08-50.13), with a median time to 50 % of pCHIK-CIR in 20.12 months. Given the reported number of patients with acute CHIK during 2014 in the Americas, our estimates suggest that from those patients, 385,835-429,058 patients will develop pCHIK-CIR.

Review of the English translation of Rudolf Virchow's de Rheumate Praesertim Corneae written in 1843.
The dissertation was more than 7000 words long. Virchow considered rheumatism as an irritant disorder not induced by acid as traditionally thought but by albumin. He concluded that inflammation was secondary to a primary irritant and that the ""seat"" of rheumatism was ""gelatinous"" (connective) tissues, which included the cornea. He divided kerato-rheumatism into different varieties. The prognosis of keratitis was variable, and would eventually lapse into ""scrofulosis, syphilis, or arthritis of the cornea.""
Virchow's dissertation characterizes rheumatism in terms of chemical and tissue interactions that make little sense in the context of today's knowledge of rheumatic disease and keratitis. Ironically, many of these concepts were made obsolete by the cellular model of disease that Virchow championed. Virchow decided to pursue the study of rheumatism through the cornea because he thought that the cornea was an ideal tissue to study disease. This discernment was passed on to his students whose seminal contributions to general pathology were based on research with the cornea. It is debatable whether Virchow's insight into the importance of the cornea in biomedical research at such an early stage of his career could have predicted his monumental contributions to medicine."

All the novel items in the 2013 ACR/EULAR criteria were frequent in the SSc cohort. Considering that there were missing data on 2 items, 10% (18/178) of the MCTD cohort met the 2013 ACR/EULAR criteria, giving an estimated specificity of 90% toward this SSc-like disorder.
In our large and representative group of consecutive patients with SSc, the 2013 ACR/EULAR SSc criteria were more sensitive than the ACR 1980 criteria. However, the new criteria did not completely segregate SSc from MCTD, making specificity a potential issue."

In local groups people with arthritis have the chance to exchange experiences and to benefit from consultation. Individual experiences are merged into a collective knowledge. Numerous printed media as well as information and exchange via the internet help to improve health literacy. Self-management courses and patient education courses are specific instruments to improve the competences of people with arthritis to manage their own condition. Through exercise programs, which are offered locally, the Association strives to improve self-efficacy regarding exercise. A survey of the members showed that the activities of the patient association are well accepted and valued. The empowered patient has more and more become a partner in the micro-level communication with their doctor. On the macro-level, patient representatives play an important role in the committees of the German self-administration of health insurance and physician organizations."
203,25260818,2014-09-28,[Depression and rheumatism: options for measuring depression].,N/A,"The importance of depressive diseases in the treatment of rheumatism patients cannot be denied. It is well-known from publications in the English speaking literature that the proportion of depressive diseases lies between 10% and 45% in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, clearly increased numbers can also be seen in a direct comparison with corresponding prevalence rates in the normal population for other diseases included in the category of rheumatism.
This manuscript focusses on the possibilities and challenges in measuring states of depressive mood that might serve as an indicator of depressive diseases in the context of treatment of rheumatism.
A search of the current literature was carried out and the results were evaluated.
Starting from appropriate background knowledge, the current state of science is discussed while subsequently taking a closer look at a choice of internationally recognized assessment tools which are feasible for use in rheumatology. Finally, this overview is accompanied by hints for hands-on practice and suggestions on how to respond to conspicuous test results indicative of a depressive mood.
The potential benefits of appropriate screening with measurement instruments are considered to be high for rheumatism patients. The measurement tools presented must be suitably selected for the individual purpose and for each rheumatology institution. In view of test application consideration must be given not only to the total score but also to the individual responses to test items. In cases of conspicuous test results the further approach must be agreed together with the patient and by choosing adequate treatment options for the situation. In cases of acute suicidal tendencies acceptance, care and support are of key importance, while the precautionary presentation in a specialist clinic must be initiated."
204,25233870,2014-09-23,2013 American College of Rheumatology/European League against rheumatism classification criteria for systemic sclerosis outperform the 1980 criteria: data from the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group.,N/A,"The goal of this study was to determine the sensitivity of the new 2013 classification criteria for systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) in an independent cohort of SSc subjects and to assess the contribution of individual items of the criteria to the overall sensitivity.
SSc subjects from the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group cohort were assessed. Sensitivity was determined in several subgroups of patients. In patients without the criterion of skin thickening proximal to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, we recalculated sensitivity after removing the individual criterion.
A total of 724 SSc patients were included. Most were women (86%), mean age was 55.8 years, mean disease duration was 10.9 years, and 59% had limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc). Overall, the sensitivity of the 2013 criteria was 98.3% compared to 88.3% for the 1980 criteria. This pattern was consistent among those with lcSSc (98.8% versus 85.6%), anticentromere antibodies (98.9% versus 79.8%), disease duration ≤3 years (98.7% versus 84.7%), and no skin involvement proximal to the MCP joints (97% versus 60%). In the latter subgroup, removing Raynaud's phenomenon and sclerodactyly from the criteria reduced the sensitivity to 77% and 79%, respectively. Removing both sclerodactyly and puffy fingers reduced the sensitivity to 62%.
The 2013 SSc classification criteria classify more SSc patients than the 1980 criteria. The improvement in sensitivity is most striking in those with lcSSc, especially those without skin involvement proximal to the MCP joints. The addition of Raynaud's phenomenon and puffy fingers to the 2013 criteria accounts for important gains in sensitivity."

US searching for synovial hypertrophy (SH) and power Doppler signal (PDUS) in 22 joints of the hands was performed in the intercritical period. The results were compared according to ACPA status and with a healthy control group (n = 30). In 10 patients, US was performed during the joint attack.
Most patients were female (63%) with a mean disease duration of 11.6 ± 10.7 years. Thirty-six patients (66.7%) were ACPA-positive. ACPA-positive patients had a shorter duration of attacks, a younger age, and less knee involvement at disease onset. US examination showed SH grade ≥ 1 in 79.6% of patients with PR and 50% of controls. Significant US results (SH ≥ 2 or PDUS) were observed in 2.7% and 1.4% of joints assessed and in 33% and 25.9% of patients with PR, respectively. Only 4 patients (7.4%) had US active synovitis (SH ≥ 2 plus PDUS) in at least 1 joint. US assessment showed no significant differences between ACPA-positive and ACPA-negative patients. PDUS was observed in 7 out of 10 patients during attacks.
Some differences emerged in the clinical phenotype of PR according to ACPA status. Most patients with PR do not have US subclinical synovitis in the intercritical period, even those who are ACPA-positive."

BTLA and Treg cells of peripheral blood in 482 patients with rheumatic diseases were observed using flow cytometry.
Lung function and the expressions of BTLA and Treg cells were lower in patients with rheumatism than those in normal controls. Lung function parameters, such as forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), forced expiratory flow at 50% of forced vital capacity (FEF50), forced expiratory flow at 75% of forced vital capacity (FEF75), were higher in the rheumatism group with normal BTLA and Treg cells than those in the group with abnormal BTLA and Treg cells (P<0.05 or P<0.01). Correlation analysis showed that there were positive correlations between lung function parameters orced vital capacity(FVC), maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV), FEV1, forced expiratory flow at 25% of forced vital capacity (FEF25), FEF50 and BTLA, Tregs. There were negative correlations between lung function parameters FVC, FEV1, FEF50, FEF75 and IL-4, IgA, IgM (P<0.05 or P<0.01).

Inflammatory arthropathy.,N/A,"Psoriatic rheumatism is an inflammatory arthropathy associated with cutaneous psoriasis that occurs mainly in adults aged between 30 and 45 years. In most cases, cutaneous phenomena precede rheumatic manifestations. Psoriatic rheumatism may begin as a monoarthritis and the diagnosis will be confirmed by the presence of psoriatic plaques or by the personal and family history of psoriasis. As a chronic proliferative epidermal disease, psoriasis is due to a genetic predisposition and it is clinically expressed following the triggering action of several factors. The onset is preceded by various events. Psoriasis is two to three times more common in patients with arthritis and about 10-20% of psoriasis patients show joint damage.
The present study aims to demonstrate the clinical and biological efficacy of biotechnology-derived biologic drugs, acting as TNFalpha antagonists and used as backup therapy, at the same time bringing new hope for broadening and improving therapy in psoriatic arthropathy.
The study included a total of 21 patients (13 men, 8 women) admitted in the interval 2011-2012 to the I-st Rheumatology Clinic of the Iasi Rehabilitation Hospital. The patients were older than 20 years and had one or more peripheral arthritis conditions, skin and nail lesions.
Based on the results, it is recommended that infliximab to be administered in patients who meet CASPAR ((Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis) diagnostic criteria, have the disease in aggressive stage, and do not respond to treatment with methotrexate (MTX) or other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs--DMARDs (leflunomide, sulfasalazine) administered for 12 weeks.
Infliximab is effective in counteracting the potentially harmful elements. It reduces the number of tender and swollen joints, improves the functional capacity and the quality of life, and slows down the radiologic progression. Infliximab is well tolerated, effective, with an optimum safety profile during short-term administration in patients with active forms of psoriatic arthropathy."

A Web-based survey was distributed across Europe and the USA using snowball sampling. Levels of agreement and application were assessed using a 0-10 rating scale (0 = none, 10 = full agreement/application). Reasons for disagreement and potential barriers to application of each recommendation were sought. Regional differences with respect to agreement and application were explored.
In total, 967 nurses, 548 rheumatologists and 2034 patients from 23 countries participated in the survey. Median level of agreement was high in all three groups, ranging from 8 to 10 per recommendation. Median level of application was substantially lower, ranging from 0 to 8 per recommendation. Agreement and application were lowest in Eastern and Central Europe. The most commonly reported reasons for incomplete agreement were too many other responsibilities (nurses), doubts about knowledge of the nurse (rheumatologists) and fear of losing contact with the rheumatologist (patients). The most commonly reported barriers to the application were time constraints and unavailability of service. Rheumatologists responses suggested that nurses had insufficient knowledge to provide the recommended care.
The EULAR recommendations for the role of nurses in the management of CIA have been disseminated among nurses, rheumatologists and patients across Europe and the USA. Agreement with these recommendations is high, but application is lower and differed across regions."

Those patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are of advanced age and require treatment with immunosuppressive agents are at particular risk to develop an infectious disease. Actual requirement and kind of treatment on the one hand, and risk of infection on the other hand, have to be considered carefully for each patient. For example, in high-risk patients, it is important to use glucocorticoids in a minimal way, i.e. in low doses and as short as possible. Vaccination, especially against influenza and pneumococci, plays an essential role in preventing infectious diseases, particularly in the elderly. Nevertheless, in cases of suspected bacterial infection, empiric antibiotic therapy should be started promptly. Due to the burden of drugs taken by patients of advanced age, the benefits and possible side effects as well as potential drug interactions have to be carefully considered. In summary, drug treatment of the elderly requires bearing in mind the complete health status of the individual patient."

All new cases of PR (n=90) were included prospectively and followed up for 1 year, and a comparison group of RA cases (n=70) was also included. At study entry in all patients in both groups, RF and anti-CCP antibodies were tested, and the findings were compared and correlated. In the PR group at presentation, RF was positive in 30 patients (33.3%) and, in the RA group, in 45 patients (64.3%). Anti-CCP antibodies were positive in 35 patients (38.9%) with PR and in 58 patients (82.9%) with RA. In the PR group, positive correlations were observed between RF and C-reactive protein (CRP) (p=0.036), while anti-CCP positively correlated with disease duration (p=0.015) and CRP (p<0.001). At 1-year follow-up, 25 cases (27.5%) had progressed to RA, 3 (3.3%) cases had developed systemic lupus, 43 cases had responded to hydroxychloroquine with complete remission, five cases had developed other rheumatic diseases, and 14 cases had progressed to undifferentiated arthritis. After regression analysis, the involvement of hand joints and positive anti-CCP were the only predictors that determined progression into RA within a year (p<0.001 and p=0.02, respectively). Early hand joint involvement and positive anti-CCP at disease onset are good predictors for progression to RA in this domain."

The 2010 American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) classification criteria focus on early-stage RA, and were specifically designed to address the deficiencies in the 1987 criteria, primarily a lack of sensitivity. However, these criteria are not intended for diagnosis in routine clinical care. RA should be suspected in the patient who presents with inflammatory polyarthritis. Initial evaluation of such patients requires a careful history and physical examination, along with select laboratory testing to identify features that are characteristic of RA or that suggest an alternative diagnosis. Radiographs should also be performed. Further research will eventually lead to more reliable diagnostic and classification criteria for new-onset RA."

TNF-α, previously known as cachectin, is implicated in the modulation of body composition and energy expenditure. Gut hormones, including acyl ghrelin, des-acyl ghrelin, GIP, GLP-1 and PYY, have been known to be the major regulators of appetite, nutrition, energy expenditure and body mass formation. Emerging evidence indicates that blockade of TNF-α by biologics not only ameliorates rheumatoid inflammation, but can affect the secretion and action of gut hormones on appetite, body composition, energy expenditure, muscle catabolism and bone remodelling. A link between the gastrointestinal endocrine axis and the immune system may be established through the interaction of proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and these gut hormones. With the ever-increasing understanding of rheumatoid inflammation and the invention of more biologics to modulate the cytokine network, more attention should be given to the possible immunomodulatory roles of gut hormones in autoimmune inflammatory reactions."

Although 119 patients had ≤ 1 involved joint in the 28-joint count but > 1 in the 44-joint count, only 34 of these 119 (2.4% of all subjects) were found to have been misclassified into remission.
In practice, about half of patients with RA can achieve clinical remission within the DAS28, SDAI, and CDAI; and one-third according to the Boolean-based definition. Patients classified in remission based on a 28-joint count may have pain and swelling in the feet, but misclassification of remission was relatively rare and was seen in only 2.4% of patients under a Boolean definition. The 28-joint count can be sufficient for assessing clinical remission based on the new remission criteria."

225,23492742,2013-03-16,The new European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for rheumatoid arthritis: how are they performing?,N/A,"This era of early aggressive treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) calls for criteria that allow timely classification of patients at risk of persistent erosive disease. We review how the new American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) classification criteria meet up to this challenge.
The new 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA were developed using initiation of methotrexate as anchor in a population with undifferentiated arthritis. Many studies from different countries have now been published that have addressed the performances of these new criteria.
The goal of earlier classification of RA seems to be met with the new criteria, but exclusion of other diagnoses is essential. Increased sensitivity comes at the price of loss of specificity and indiscriminate use of these classification criteria as a diagnostic tool carries the risk of overtreatment."
226,23436737,2013-02-26,European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index and European League Against Rheumatism Sjögren's Syndrome Patient-Reported Index: a complete picture of primary Sjögren's syndrome patients.,N/A,"The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) and the EULAR SS Patient-Reported Index (ESSPRI) were recently developed. We aimed to determine whether patients' symptoms differed between patients with and without systemic involvement and if the disease-specific indices correlated with each other in primary SS.
Fifteen French centers included 395 primary SS patients in the Assessment of Systemic Signs and Evolution in Sjögren's Syndrome Cohort. At enrollment, physicians completed the ESSDAI, the SS Disease Activity Index (SSDAI), and the Sjögren's Systemic Clinical Activity Index (SCAI), and patients completed the ESSPRI, the Sicca Symptoms Inventory, and the Profile of Fatigue and Discomfort. All scores were compared between patients with and without systemic involvement. Correlations between scores of systemic activity and patients' symptoms were obtained.
At enrollment, 120 (30.4%) patients had never experienced systemic complication and 155 (39.2%) patients and 120 (30.4%) patients had, respectively, only past or current systemic manifestations. Past or current systemic patients had higher levels of symptoms, except dryness. The ESSDAI did not correlate with the patient-scored ESSPRI (rho = 0.06, P = 0.30), whereas the SSDAI and the SCAI, which include subjective items, did correlate (rho = 0.28 and 0.25, respectively; P < 0.0001 for both).
Alterations of common patient-reported outcomes are present in all patients with primary SS, including those with systemic complications. However, patient symptoms and systemic complications are 2 different facets of primary SS. Therefore, the use of both systemic and patients' indices, such as the ESSDAI and ESSPRI, are useful. Since these 2 facets weakly overlap, one should identify which of both components is the main target of the treatment to test, when designing clinical trials in primary SS."

Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are more effective when started early. Biotherapies are not available. Given the socioeconomic constraints in sub-Saharan Africa, treatments must be selected based on locally available resources. The objective of this study was to evaluate outcomes 6 months after initiation of conventional DMARDs in Senegalese patients with RA.
We retrospectively studied consecutive RA patients seen at the rheumatology outpatient clinic of the Le Dantec Teaching Hospital, Dakar, Senegal, from January 2005 through June 2009. All patients met the ACR criteria for RA. ACR and EULAR response criteria were evaluated 6 months after treatment initiation.
The study included 205 patients. Corticosteroids were used in 205 patients, hydroxychloroquine in 190, methotrexate in 137, and sulfasalazine in 11. Combined corticosteroid, methotrexate, and hydroxychloroquine therapy was used in 122 patients and combined corticosteroid and hydroxychloroquine therapy in 63. DMARD treatment was interrupted for at least 5 days per month for 26% of the patients, either because the drugs were out of stock at the local pharmacies and/or because the patients could not afford to purchase them. During the first 6 months of treatment, patients had a mean of 4 clinic visits, and 48% of patients missed at least one scheduled visit. After 6 months, all clinical variables had improved significantly, except the swollen joint count. The ACR20, 50, and 70 response criteria were met in 50%, 31%, and 6.9% of patients, respectively. The EULAR response was good in 53.9% of patients, moderate in 12.7%, and poor in 23.1%. DMARD therapy failed in 10.3% of patients. Half the patients had their treatment modified during the 6-month study period. DMARD therapy was discontinued in 10 patients for the following reasons: plans to become pregnant, n = 5; pregnancy during treatment, n = 2; and tuberculosis, n = 3.
In Senegal, the treatment of RA relies chiefly on variable combinations of methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, and corticosteroids. The six-month outcomes are satisfactory. Biotherapy is required in 7% to 10% of patients, a rate that could be decreased by optimizing patient follow-up. The management of chronic inflammatory joint disease couple be improved despite the limited financial resources in sub-Saharan Africa with better physician training and the incorporation of osteoarticular diseases within a vast information and education program for the general population."

Four hundred and four patients suffering from arthritis were included in the study. Two hundred and twenty-one of them were classified as RA patients and 183 had alternative diagnoses. The patients were further subdivided into three groups according to their disease duration of within one year, one to two years or more than two years. The diagnostic value of ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria for RA was evaluated by comparing the sensitivity and specificity with those of ACR 1987 criteria in these patients.
The sensitivity and specificity of ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria for diagnosing RA were 95% and 92.9%, respectively. In contrast, the sensitivity and specificity of ACR 1987 criteria were 81.4% and 92.9%, respectively. The efficacy of ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria was superior to the ACR 1987 criteria by comparing their area under the curves (AUC) (0.940, 95% CI [0.912, 0.967] vs. 0.872, 95% CI [0.835, 0.909]). The recognition accuracy of ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria was higher than that of ACR 1987 criteria (94.5% vs. 86.6%, P<0.05). Inter-rater analysis showed that agreement of the two criteria was substantial (Kappa=0.744, P<0.001). For patients with disease duration within one year, one to two years and over two years, the sensitivities of ACR 1987 criteria were 69.2%, 81.3% and 89.9%, while the specificities were 94.4%, 90.6% and 92%, respectively. The corresponding sensitivities of ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria in these patients were 91%, 93.8% and 98.2%, while the corresponding specificities were 94.4%, 96.6% and 89.3%, respectively. The advantage of ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria over 1987 criteria in higher sensitivity was remarkable particularly in patients with disease duration within one year (P<0.001).
The ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria is more accurate in RA diagnosis compared to the ACR 1987 criteria by elevating the sensitivity while preserving the specificity, especially in patients with disease duration within one year. The ACR/EULAR 2010 criteria may serve as new diagnostic tools in daily clinical practice."

We undertook this study to determine the optimized definition of ultrasound-detected synovitis for the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria and to assess the impact of its use on the accuracy of RA classification.
One hundred nine patients with musculoskeletal symptoms for ≤3 years were enrolled in the study. Patients underwent clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and comprehensive ultrasonographic assessments at baseline and received routine management from expert rheumatologists who were blinded to the ultrasound findings.
Sensitivity and specificity of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria using different definitions of synovitis to identify patients who developed a disease requiring methotrexate (MTX) treatment within 1 year were 58.5% and 79.4%, respectively, for clinical synovitis (tenderness or swelling), 78.0% and 79.4%, respectively, for ultrasound-detected synovitis with a gray-scale (GS) imaging score≥1 (GS≥1 ultrasound synovitis), and 56.1% and 93.7%, respectively, for GS≥2 ultrasound synovitis or a synovial power Doppler (PD) signal score≥1 (GS≥2/PD≥1 ultrasound synovitis). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the criteria scores revealed the largest area under the curve with GS≥2/PD≥1 ultrasound synovitis.
Ultrasound assessment improves the accuracy of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria for identifying patients with a disease requiring MTX treatment. Our data provide preliminary but vital information for the methodology to confirm the presence of synovitis using ultrasound in the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria."

Little is known on their prognostic factors. The aim of this prognostic study was to search the determinants of lingering or relapsing RMSP indicative of CHIK-R.
Three hundred and forty-six infected adults (age≥15 years) having declared RMSP at disease onset were extracted from the TELECHIK cohort study, Reunion island, and analyzed using a multinomial logistic regression model. We also searched for the predictors of CHIKV-specific IgG titres, assessed at the time of a serosurvey, using multiple linear regression analysis.
Of these, 111 (32.1%) reported relapsing RMSP, 150 (43.3%) lingering RMSP, and 85 (24.6%) had fully recovered (reference group) on average two years after acute infection. In the final model controlling for gender, the determinants of relapsing RMSP were the age 45-59 years (adjusted OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.0, 8.6) or greater or equal than 60 years (adjusted OR: 10.4, 95% CI: 3.5, 31.1), severe rheumatic involvement (fever, at least six joints plus four other symptoms) at presentation (adjusted OR: 3.6, 95% CI: 1.5, 8.2), and CHIKV-specific IgG titres (adjusted OR: 3.2, 95% CI: 1.8, 5.5, per one unit increase). Prognostic factors for lingering RMSP were age 45-59 years (adjusted OR: 6.4, 95% CI: 1.8, 22.1) or greater or equal than 60 years (adjusted OR: 22.3, 95% CI: 6.3, 78.1), severe initial rheumatic involvement (adjusted OR: 5.5, 95% CI: 2.2, 13.8) and CHIKV-specific IgG titres (adjusted OR: 6.2, 95% CI: 2.8, 13.2, per one unit increase). CHIKV specific IgG titres were positively correlated with age, female gender and the severity of initial rheumatic symptoms.
Our data support the roles of age, severity at presentation and CHIKV specific IgG titres for predicting CHIK-R. By identifying the prognostic value of the humoral immune response of the host, this work also suggest a significant contribution of the adaptive immune response to the physiopathology of CHIK-R and should help to reconsider the paradigm of this chronic infection primarily shifted towards the involvement of the innate immune response."

The 2010 ACR/EULAR classification criteria for RA were developed aiming to identify patients early in the natural history of the disease. Validation studies conducted since their publication have demonstrated that, compared with the 1987 ACR criteria for RA, the 2010 criteria identify more patients earlier in the disease course. Sensitivity for the initiation of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and persistent disease is increased, with decreased specificity. Patients who are seronegative may not satisfy the 2010 criteria despite meeting the 1987 criteria at presentation. The 2010 criteria may also incorrectly classify some patients with self-limiting disease as RA.
The 2010 criteria appear to be superior to the 1987 criteria in terms of identifying individuals with early RA. Their validity in established disease and their ability to predict worse prognosis in the long term have yet to be determined."

The group included 69 men and 90 women (mean age 47.6); forty-nine suffering from rheumatoid arthritis, 61 with psoriatic arthritis, 32 with ankylosing spondylitis and 17 with other spondyloarthritis; 146 patients were treated with anti-TNF-α, 7 with rituximab and 6 with abatacept; 128 patients assumed DMARDs and 72 patients assumed low dose of steroids. A case of ILI was identified by anamnestic findings and according to the case definitions commonly used in Europe. Seventeen percent of the considered population reported at least one episode of ILI during the monitoring period; none of the patients during the acute influenza attack suffered particularly severe symptoms and no one was hospitalized due to complications. Despite the diversity among the considered subgroups, the statistical analysis did not show any significant difference when incidence of ILI was considered for different disease, different biological agent and different association therapy. None of the examined variables resulted statistically significant concerning the relative risk evaluation. The incidence of ILI into a cohort of 159 patients treated with biological agents during the influenza season 2009-2010 resulted higher than the value reported in a wide sample of Italian population in the same period. However, the pandemic impact was not heavy among the studied patients, considering that no important complications or hospitalizations have been reported."

They are usually included among the non-Langerhans histiocytoses, but recent insights drive some criticism. The diagnosis is often challenging and must be confirmed by the histological typical features. If the skin manifestations are missing, the arthritic complaints may be confused with those of other rheumatic disorders. In these cases, only a careful clinical and radiological evaluation leads to the correct diagnosis. The natural course of the diseases may rapidly develop into disabling manifestations, making an aggressive treatment strongly recommendable. There is emerging evidence that anti-tumour necrosis factor-α agents and bisphosphonates are promising drugs for MRH, while a course of methotrexate and steroids seems to be the best option for FR. Finally, the clinician should be aware that in many cases MRH, but not FR, is associated with a large number of systemic manifestations and with malignancy. This eventuality must be accurately ruled out."

Case notes were reviewed to determine which criteria were fulfilled at initial, 3-month, 1-year, and 2-year visits. Requirements for disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy and presence of joint erosions were compared at 2 years.
At the initial visit, twice as many patients fulfilled the 2010 criteria (67%) compared with the 1987 criteria (34%; p < 0.001). Forty-four percent of patients who fulfilled only the 2010 criteria at the initial visit went on to fulfill both 1987 and 2010 criteria at 3 months (p < 0.001). Eight patients did not meet the 1987 RA criteria solely because of short symptom duration. All 17/79 patients who developed joint erosions went on to eventually fulfill both criteria.

Immunosuppressive treatment should be guided by renal biopsy, and aiming for complete renal response (proteinuria <0.5 g/24 h with normal or near-normal renal function). Hydroxychloroquine is recommended for all patients with LN. Because of a more favourable efficacy/toxicity ratio, as initial treatment for patients with class III-IV(A) or (A/C) (±V) LN according to the International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society 2003 classification, mycophenolic acid (MPA) or low-dose intravenous cyclophosphamide (CY) in combination with glucocorticoids is recommended. In patients with adverse clinical or histological features, CY can be prescribed at higher doses, while azathioprine is an alternative for milder cases. For pure class V LN with nephrotic-range proteinuria, MPA in combination with oral glucocorticoids is recommended as initial treatment. In patients improving after initial treatment, subsequent immunosuppression with MPA or azathioprine is recommended for at least 3 years; in such cases, initial treatment with MPA should be followed by MPA. For MPA or CY failures, switching to the other agent, or to rituximab, is the suggested course of action. In anticipation of pregnancy, patients should be switched to appropriate medications without reducing the intensity of treatment. There is no evidence to suggest that management of LN should differ in children versus adults.

The aim this study was to evaluate conceptual agreement of ASsessment in SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS) and the EUropean League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the management of AS and EULAR recommendations for RA and to assess the rate of application among Turkish physiatrists in daily clinical practice.
An online survey link has been sent to 1756 Turkish physiatrists with e-mails asking to rate agreement on 11-item ASAS/EULAR AS recommendations and 15-item EULAR RA recommendations with synthetic and biological disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Also barriers and difficulties for using biologic agents were assessed.
Three hundred nine physiatrists (17.5%) completed the survey. The conceptual agreement with both recommendations was very high (Level of agreement; mean 8.35±0.82 and 8.90± 0.67 for RA and AS recommendations, respectively), and the self-declared application of overall recommendations in the clinical practice was also high for both RA and AS (72.42% and 75.71%, respectively).
Turkish physiatrists are in good conceptual agreement with the evidence-based recommendations for the management of AS and RA. These efforts may serve to disseminate the knowledge and increase the current awareness among physicians who serve to these patients and also implementation of these recommendations is expected to increase as well."

Candidate criteria were evaluated in a 6-month prospective cohort study of 125 patients with new-onset PMR and 169 non-PMR comparison subjects with conditions mimicking PMR. A scoring algorithm was developed based on morning stiffness >45 minutes (2 points), hip pain/limited range of motion (1 point), absence of rheumatoid factor and/or anti-citrullinated protein antibody (2 points), and absence of peripheral joint pain (1 point). A score ≥4 had 68% sensitivity and 78% specificity for discriminating all comparison subjects from PMR. The specificity was higher (88%) for discriminating shoulder conditions from PMR and lower (65%) for discriminating RA from PMR. Adding ultrasound, a score ≥5 had increased sensitivity to 66% and specificity to 81%. According to these provisional classification criteria, patients ≥50 years old presenting with bilateral shoulder pain, not better explained by an alternative pathology, can be classified as having PMR in the presence of morning stiffness >45 minutes, elevated C-reactive protein and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and new hip pain.

248,22012029,2011-10-21,[Diabetes and rheumatism: is diabetes mellitus also an inflammatory disease?].,N/A,"New studies have demonstrated similarities in the complex pathomechanisms of diabetes mellitus type 1 (T₁D) and rheumatic diseases and in particular rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Common HLA gene complex characteristics and polymorphisms of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) play a special role in both disorders. The metabolic syndrome, associated with insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus type 2 (T₂D), often shows criteria of a subclinical chronic inflammation. New forms of therapy with monoclonal antibodies against TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 have improved the management of patients with RA. Cytokine-induced inflammation also seems to be important in the pathogenesis and progression of T₁D and T₂D. Whether a therapy with the same monoclonal antibodies established in RA could also be successful in diabetes still has to be investigated in further studies. Both RA and T₁D are autoimmune disorders and show a cumulative incidence with further autoimmune diseases."

Histopathology in the correct clinical context confirms the diagnosis. Treatment is based on observational data from single case reports.
We describe 4 cases, review histologic findings, and discuss therapeutic responses.
Cases coded as fibroblastic rheumatism were retrieved from institutional and consultation files. Medical charts and biopsy specimens were reviewed. Elastic stains and immunostains for smooth muscle actin, S100, CD34, desmin, and epithelial membrane antigen were performed on selected cases.
Four cases were identified. Patients displayed cutaneous nodules and arthralgias. Flexion contractures/decreased motion were present in two patients; one patient had associated Raynaud phenomenon and erosive joint disease. Biopsy specimens demonstrated a fibroblastic proliferation associated with a collagenous stroma. Growth patterns varied from cellular fascicles to paucicellular randomly arranged spindle cells. Elastic fibers were absent in all cases tested (3/3). Immunohistochemical stains demonstrated immunoreactivity for smooth muscle actin in one of 3 cases in a myofibroblastic pattern. Other stains were negative. One patient had complete resolution of disease with methotrexate. One patient partially responded to interferon-alfa and ribavirin and was subsequently treated with methotrexate with additional improvement. One patient had limited response to all therapies attempted. One patient was lost to follow-up.
Small sample size (n = 4) is a limitation.
Our data expand the clinical, histologic, and therapeutic response data on fibroblastic rheumatism. Correlation with clinical history is critical to avoid misdiagnosis as other fibrosing lesions. Methotrexate and interferon-alfa are potential therapies."

With the additional development of composite measures to estimate the disease activity of RA, it was the goal of an international working group consisting of rheumatologists and patients to develop recommendations for treating rheumatoid arthritis in a similar way as for patients with hypertension or diabetes, with the aim to achieve remission as often as possible. This treat-to-target initiative has taken off in quite a number of different countries including Germany leading to discussions on how this initiative can be integrated into the specific national healthcare systems and what possibilities would exist for its implementation. To develop strategies for an improved healthcare of people suffering from rheumatic diseases and using RA as an example, action elements and postulates were developed which will be discussed in more detail in the present manuscript."

Clear consensual treatment guidance focused on the musculoskeletal manifestations of PsA would be advantageous. The authors present European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for the treatment of PsA with systemic or local (non-topical) symptomatic and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARD).
The recommendations are based on evidence from systematic literature reviews performed for non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), glucocorticoids, synthetic DMARD and biological DMARD. This evidence was discussed, summarised and recommendations were formulated by a task force comprising 35 representatives, and providing levels of evidence, strength of recommendations and levels of agreement.
Ten recommendations were developed for treatment from NSAID through synthetic DMARD to biological agents, accounting for articular and extra-articular manifestations of PsA. Five overarching principles and a research agenda were defined.
These recommendations are intended to provide rheumatologists, patients and other stakeholders with a consensus on the pharmacological treatment of PsA and strategies to reach optimal outcomes, based on combining evidence and expert opinion. The research agenda informs directions within EULAR and other communities interested in PsA."

The study group comprised 301 disease-modifying antirheumatic drug-naive patients with early arthritis. The baseline diagnosis was assessed by applying the 1987 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria for RA as well as established diagnostic criteria for other rheumatic diseases. Diagnostic and prognostic data were collected after 2 years of followup. Fulfillment of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria was evaluated in the subset of patients in whom undifferentiated arthritis (UA) was diagnosed when the 1987 ACR criteria were applied, and fulfillment of RA criteria over time was tested by applying the 2 different criteria sets.
The median arthritis duration at baseline was 4 months (range 0-12 months). At baseline, 28% of the patients fulfilled the 1987 ACR criteria, and 45% fulfilled the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria for RA. Among the patients classified as having UA at baseline according to the 1987 ACR criteria, 36% had fulfilled the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria already at baseline. Among the patients classified as having UA at baseline but who fulfilled the 1987 ACR criteria after 2 years of followup, 85% had fulfilled the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria at baseline. Patients with early disease who fulfilled the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria were less likely to be autoantibody positive and more likely to have monarthritis at presentation than those fulfilling the 1987 ACR criteria.
Use of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria clearly allows earlier diagnosis of RA, although the clinical picture is slightly different on the group level, and RA may be falsely diagnosed in some patients with self-limiting disease."
253,21896342,2011-09-08,Vaccination in paediatric patients with auto-immune rheumatic diseases: a systemic literature review for the European League against Rheumatism evidence-based recommendations.,N/A,"To analyze available evidence on vaccinations in paediatric patients with rheumatic and autoinflammatory diseases. This evidence formed the basis of the recently constructed European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for vaccination of these patients.
A systematic literature review in the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was conducted using various terms for vaccinations, paediatric rheumatic and autoinflammatory diseases and immunosuppressive drugs. Only papers on paediatric patients (<18 years of age) were selected. A panel of 13 experts in the field graded methodological quality and extracted data using predefined criteria.
27 papers were available. No studies were found on autoinflammatory diseases. 14 studies considered live-attenuated vaccines. Evidence so far supports the safety and immunogenicity of non-live composite vaccines, although studies were underpowered to accurately assess safety. Live-attenuated vaccines did not cause disease flares or severe adverse events, not even in patients on methotrexate and low dose glucocorticosteroids. Seven patients on anti-TNFalpha therapy were described receiving the live-attenuated measles, mumps, rubella (n=5) or varicella (n=2) booster without severe adverse events.
Data on safety and efficacy of vaccinations in paediatric patients with rheumatic diseases is reassuring, but too limited to draw definite conclusions. More research is needed on the safety and efficacy of especially live-attenuated vaccines in patients with rheumatic and autoinflammatory diseases using high dose immunosuppressive drugs."

Remission was examined using data on 1,341 patients with RA (91% men) from the US Department of Veterans Affairs RA (VARA) registry (total of 9,700 visits) and 1,153 patients with RA (25.8% men) in a community rheumatology practice (Arthritis and Rheumatology Clinics of Kansas [ARCK]) (total of 6,362 visits). Cross-sectional and cumulative probabilities were studied, and agreement between the various remission criteria was assessed. Aspects of reliability of the criteria were determined using Boolean-based definitions, as well as the Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) and Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) scoring methods proposed by the ACR/EULAR joint committee.
When the 3-variable ACR/EULAR definition of remission recommended for use in community practice (swollen and tender joint counts ≤1, and visual analog scale score for patient's global assessment of disease activity ≤1) was applied, cross-sectional remission was 7.5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 6.4, 8.7%) for ARCK and 8.9% (95% CI 7.9, 9.9%) for VARA, and cumulative remission (remission at any observation) was 18.0% (for ARCK) and 24.4% (for VARA), over a mean followup of ∼2.2 years. Addition of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein level to the criteria set reduced remission to 5.0-6.2%, and use of the CDAI/SDAI increased the proportions to 6.9-10.1%. Moreover, 1.8-4.6% of the patients met remission criteria at ≥2 visits. Agreement between criteria definitions was good, as assessed by kappa statistics and Jaccard coefficients. Among patients in remission, the probability of a remission lasting 2 years was 6.0-14.1%. Among all patients, the probability of a remission lasting 2 years was <3%. Remission status and examination results for each patient varied substantially among physicians, as determined by multilevel analyses.
Cross-sectional remission occurred in 5.0-10.1% of the patients in these cohorts, with cumulative remission being 2-3 times greater; however, long-term remission was rare. Problems with reliability and agreement limit the usefulness of these criteria in the individual patient. However, the criteria can be an effective method for measuring clinical status and treatment effect in groups of patients in the community."

Among others, the activity of the immune system is subject to daily variability which explains the different intensity of rheumatic symptoms during the day (e.g. morning stiffness). Circadian rhythms are subject to continuous adaptation via external time signals (zeitgebers), such as light-dark periods, time of food intake, as well as daily activity and resting periods. Following an acute phase shift of these external zeitgebers, e.g. via transmeridian travel (east-west or west-east), the body has to adjust all circadian systems to these new circumstances during an adjustment response, which lasts for several days. The classical symptoms of jet lag, such as tiredness during the day, mood swings and cognitive malfunction occur during this adjustment period. The impact of acute phase shifts as a result of transmeridian travel in subjects with rheumatic disorders, as well as strategies to prevent jet lag will be discussed in the following article."

There was no visceral involvement, and all the routine and immunological tests were normal. The diagnosis of FR was confirmed by histological examination of a nodule, which composed of myofibroblastic proliferation and thickened collagen fibers. Most skin lesions resolved after treated with IFN-α, however there was sequelae of permanent disability due to the progressive bone erosion despite weekly methotrexate treatment."

Now the individual items that make up these criteria are being evaluated. This study was undertaken to analyze the item ""autoantibodies,"" in particular rheumatoid factor (RF) level.
Three separate cohorts comprising a total of 972 patients with undifferentiated arthritis were studied for RA development (according to the 1987 American College of Rheumatology criteria) and arthritis persistence. The positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and likelihood ratios (LRs) were compared between different levels of RF and the presence of anti-citrullinated protein antibody (ACPA). A similar comparison was made in 686 RA patients for the rate of joint destruction and achievement of sustained disease-modifying antirheumatic drug-free remission during 7 years of followup. The variation in RF levels obtained by different measurement methods in the same RF-positive sera was explored.
Compared to high RF levels, presence of ACPA had a better balance between positive LR and negative LR and between PPV and NPV for RA development. The additive value of ACPA assessment after testing for RF level was higher than vice versa. The association between high RF level and RA severity was not as strong as that between ACPA antibodies and RA severity. The RF level obtained by different methods in the same patients' sera varied considerably.
Our findings indicate that determination of RF level is subject to large variation; high RF level has limited additive prognostic value compared to ACPA positivity. Thus, omitting RF level and using RF presence, ACPA presence, and ACPA level may improve the 2010 criteria for RA."

The general population was convinced of the efficacy of this treatment for centuries, even requesting it on occasion on a prophylactic basis. Although questioned early in history, the number of sceptical voices increased in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1835, P. Louis introduced statistics to medicine in Paris, thereby proving the inefficacy of bloodletting in inflammatory diseases. Today, bloodletting is used in scientific medicine in only a few rare disease.As long as rheumatic diseases remained undifferentiated, all cases were treated with bloodletting. After acute articular rheumatism 1591 was recognised as an independent disease entity, bloodletting remained the treatment of choice for most doctors right up to the end of the 19th century. Bloodletting was also the standard treatment for gout from antiquity up to the beginning of the 19th century. Following its differentiation in 1800, chronic articular rheumatism was no longer treated with venae sectio. Today, there is no indication for bloodletting therapy in rheumatology."

This work was undertaken to develop such a definition.
A committee consisting of members of the American College of Rheumatology, the European League Against Rheumatism, and the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology Initiative met to guide the process and review prespecified analyses from RA clinical trials. The committee requested a stringent definition (little, if any, active disease) and decided to use core set measures including, as a minimum, joint counts and levels of an acute-phase reactant to define remission. Members were surveyed to select the level of each core set measure that would be consistent with remission. Candidate definitions of remission were tested, including those that constituted a number of individual measures of remission (Boolean approach) as well as definitions using disease activity indexes. To select a definition of remission, trial data were analyzed to examine the added contribution of patient-reported outcomes and the ability of candidate measures to predict later good radiographic and functional outcomes.
Survey results for the definition of remission suggested indexes at published thresholds and a count of core set measures, with each measure scored as 1 or less (e.g., tender and swollen joint counts, C-reactive protein [CRP] level, and global assessments on a 0-10 scale). Analyses suggested the need to include a patient-reported measure. Examination of 2-year followup data suggested that many candidate definitions performed comparably in terms of predicting later good radiographic and functional outcomes, although 28-joint Disease Activity Score-based measures of remission did not predict good radiographic outcomes as well as the other candidate definitions did. Given these and other considerations, we propose that a patient's RA can be defined as being in remission based on one of two definitions: (a) when scores on the tender joint count, swollen joint count, CRP (in mg/dl), and patient global assessment (0-10 scale) are all ≤ 1, or (b) when the score on the Simplified Disease Activity Index is ≤ 3.3.

A systematic literature review was presented during a first task force meeting, including 3 rheumatologists, 1 rheumatologist/epidemiologist, 2 allied health professionals, 2 representatives of arthritis research organisations and 7 patient representatives, resulting in 38 statements. A Delphi method was carried out to reduce and refine the statements and agree on a set of eight. Next, a survey among a wider group of experts, professionals and patient representatives (n=42), was completed. Feedback from this wider group was discussed at the second meeting and integrated in the final wording of the recommendations. Subsequently, the level of agreement of the group of experts (n=81) was re-evaluated.
The project resulted in a definition of patient research partner and agreement on a set of eight recommendations for their involvement in research projects. These recommendations provide practical guidance for organising patient participation, capturing (1) the role of patient research partners, (2) phase of involvement, (3) the recommended number, (4) recruitment, (5) selection, (6) support, (7) training and (8) acknowledgement.
Collaboration between patients and professionals in research is relatively new. Trials or effectiveness studies are not yet available. Nevertheless, it is possible to define recommendations for the inclusion of patients in research following a solid expert opinion based consensus process."

The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) CPPD Task Force, comprising 15 experts from 10 countries, agreed the terms and recommendations for diagnosis of CPPD using a Delphi consensus approach. Evidence was systematically reviewed and presented in terms of sensitivity, specificity and positive likelihood ratio (LR) to support diagnosis; ORs were used for association. Strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed by the EULAR visual analogue scale.
It was agreed that 'CPPD' should be the umbrella term that includes acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis, osteoarthritis (OA) with CPPD and chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis. Chondrocalcinosis (CC) defines cartilage calcification, most commonly due to CPPD and detected by imaging or histological examination. A total of 11 key recommendations were generated on the topics of clinical features, synovial fluid (SF) examination, imaging, comorbidities and risk factors. Definitive diagnosis of CPPD relies on identification of SF CPP crystals. Rapid onset inflammatory symptoms and signs are suggestive but not definitive for acute CPP crystal arthritis. Radiographic CC is not highly sensitive or specific, whereas ultrasonography appears more useful (LR=24.2, 95% CI 3.51 to 168.01) for peripheral joints. Recognised risk factors for CPPD include ageing, OA and metabolic conditions such as primary hyperparathyroidism, haemochromatosis and hypomagnesaemia; familial forms are rare. SORs varied from 53 to 99 (maximum 100).
New terms for CPPD were agreed and 11 key recommendations for diagnosis of CPPD were developed using research evidence and expert consensus."

AIIRD, vaccines and immunomodulating drugs, as well as eight key questions were defined by the multidisciplinary expert committee commissioned by EULAR for developing the recommendations. A SLR was performed using MedLine through October 2009 and including data from meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized trials, and observational studies, excluding case series with ≤ 5 participants. Articles in English and regarding patients ≥ 16 years of age, were eligible.
Several vaccine-preventable infections (VPI) occur more often in AIIRD-patients and most vaccines are efficacious in AIIRD-patients, even when treated with immunomodulating agents, except rituximab. There does not appear to be an increase in vaccination-related harms in vaccinated patients with AIIRD in comparison with unvaccinated patients with AIIRD. However, these studies are underpowered and therefore not conclusive.
Based on the current evidence from the literature, recommendations for vaccination in patients with AIIRD were made. However, more research is needed in particular regarding incidence of VPI, harms of vaccination and the influence of (new and established) immunomodulating agents on vaccination efficacy."

The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in classification between the 1987 ACR criteria and the 2010 ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria in an early arthritis cohort and to determine the test characteristics of the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria.
A total of 2,258 patients with early arthritis included in the Leiden Early Arthritis Clinic cohort were studied. Fulfillment of the 1987 and 2010 criteria for the classification of RA was determined at baseline. The diagnosis of each patient at 1 year was assessed. The sensitivity and specificity of the 2010 criteria were determined using the following outcome measures: initiation of methotrexate therapy or any disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy during the first year of followup and having persistent arthritis during 5 years of followup.
At their first presentation, 1,099 patients fulfilled the 2010 criteria, and 726 patients fulfilled the 1987 criteria for RA. Eighty-two of the 726 patients fulfilling the 1987 criteria did not fulfill the 2010 criteria. Sixty-eight percent of the patients who fulfilled the 1987 criteria during the first year of disease but not at baseline did fulfill the 2010 criteria at baseline. In 18% of patients, use of the 2010 classification criteria also led to a revoked classification at 1 year. The sensitivity and specificity of the 2010 criteria were 0.84 and 0.60, respectively, with methotrexate therapy as the outcome and 0.74 and 0.74, respectively, with DMARD therapy as the outcome. With persistent arthritis as the outcome, the sensitivity and specificity of the 2010 criteria were 0.71 and 0.65, respectively.
Compared with the 1987 criteria, the 2010 criteria classify more patients with RA and at an earlier phase of the disease. The discriminative ability of the 2010 criteria is acceptable."

The aim of Phase 2 of the development process was to achieve expert consensus on the clinical and laboratory variables that should contribute to the final criteria set.
Twenty-four expert RA clinicians (12 from Europe and 12 from North America) participated in Phase 2. A consensus-based decision analysis approach was used to identify factors (and their relative weights) that influence the probability of ""developing RA,"" complemented by data from the Phase 1 study. Patient case scenarios were used to identify and reach consensus on factors important in determining the probability of RA development. Decision analytic software was used to derive the relative weights for each of the factors and their categories, using choice-based conjoint analysis.
The expert panel agreed that the new classification criteria should be applied to individuals with undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis in whom at least 1 joint is deemed by an expert assessor to be swollen, indicating definite synovitis. In this clinical setting, they identified 4 additional criteria as being important: number of joints involved and site of involvement, serologic abnormality, acute-phase response, and duration of symptoms in the involved joints. These criteria were consistent with those identified in the Phase 1 data-driven approach.
The consensus-based, decision analysis approach used in Phase 2 complemented the Phase 1 efforts. The 4 criteria and their relative weights form the basis of the final criteria set."

In this first phase of the collaborative effort of the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism to develop new criteria for RA, a pooled analysis of early arthritis cohorts made available by the respective investigators is presented. All the variables associated with the gold standard of treatment with methotrexate during the first year after enrolment were first identified. Principal component analysis was then used to identify among the significant variables those sets that represent similar domains. In a final step, from each domain one representative variable was extracted, all of which were then tested for their independent effects in a multivariate regression model. From the OR in that final model, the relative weight of each variable was estimated.
The final domains and variables identified by this process (and their relative weights) were: swelling of a metacarpophalangeal joint (MCP; 1.5), swelling of a proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP; 1.5), swelling of the wrist (1.5), tenderness of the hand (ie, MCP, PIP or wrist (2)), acute phase reaction (ie, C reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate and weights for moderate or high elevations of either one (1 for moderate, 2 for high elevation)) and serological abnormalities (ie, rheumatoid factors or anti-citrullinated protein antibodies, again with separate weights for moderate or high elevations (2 and 4, respectively)).

The same variables were also investigated in 38 healthy controls.
Eleven out of 28 patients with PR developed RA. The prevalence of anti-CCP antibodies in the PR patients who developed RA was significantly higher compared to the patients who did not. Proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint involvement at baseline was also predictive towards the development of RA. Compared with the controls, differences in the frequency of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on padi4_104 [T(RA susceptible)-->C(RA non-susceptible)] and the presence of an RA susceptible homozygote of the PADI4 haplotype were detected in patients with PR whereas we could not find any further difference in PR patients who developed RA compared to PR patients who do not develop RA in PADI4. None of the subjects possessed the PTPN22 SNP (1858C-->T). Cox regression analysis revealed that anti-CCP antibodies as well as PIP involvement are the most relevant variables for the development of RA from PR. None of the PR patients with either HLA-DRB1*SE alleles (or the HLA-DRB1*0405 allele) or anti-CCP antibodies developed RA.

Twenty-four patients had died by 2006, 17 (42%) in the RA group and 7 (35%) in the non-RA group. Nine patients, all in the RA group (23%), had received 1 or more joint replacements. The mean HAQ score was 0.57 in the non-RA survivors (mean age 70 yrs), compared to 0.89 in the RA group (mean age 66 yrs) (p = 0.020, adjusted for age). Pain scores and the number of painful joints were similar between the groups.
Two-thirds of the patients with PR developed chronic arthritis. The risk to develop chronic arthritis remained over 10 years. The RA group was characterized with functional declines and having joint replacements as longterm outcomes of the disease."
291,19615014,2009-07-21,Fibroblastic rheumatism: fibromatosis rather than non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis.,N/A,"Fibroblastic rheumatism is a unique fibro-proliferative disease affecting the skin and joints. It is characterized by distinctive clinical and histological features related to benign spindle-shaped cells proliferation. Pediatric reports are scarce in the literature.
We describe here a new case in a 10-year-old boy and discuss the potential origin of the cell proliferation.
Clinical findings, radiology, microscopic examination and outcome are reviewed. Histopathology and immunochemistry studies were performed on skin biospies using CD68, CD163, desmin, factor XIIIa, CD34, smooth muscle actin, PS100, epithelial membrane antigen, and calponin.
Histological sections disclosed a rather circumscribed nonencapsulated nodular infiltrate, invading the dermis and the upper subcutaneous tissue, consisted of a proliferation of spindle or stellate-shaped cells and thickened collagen fibers. Orcein staining showed disappearance of the elastic network. Aponeurosis and muscle were normal. A mild perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate was noted. Calponin-staining was less strongly expressed as SMA, and some of them but not all were CD68 positive, as well. On the other hand, all were CD34, CD163, FXIIIa, PS100, EMA and desmin-negative.
The true origin of these cells remains unclear. Some authors have speculated a histiocytic origin. However, immuno-chemical staining in our case failed to confirm this hypothesis and instead supported a fibroblastic/myofibroblastic origin. Given the clinical course and the histological and immunohistochemical results, we suggest that FR should be added to the group of fibromatoses."
292,19565540,2009-07-01,Factors associated with depression and suicidal ideation among individuals with arthritis or rheumatism: findings from a representative community survey.,N/A,"To investigate factors associated with depression and suicidal ideation among individuals with arthritis or rheumatism.
The nationally representative Canadian Community Health Survey 2000-2001 included 130,880 respondents (response rate 84.7%). Respondents were diagnosed as depressed using a subset of items from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview. There were 23,405 respondents age > or =20 years who reported that they had been diagnosed with arthritis or rheumatism by a health professional. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate depression and suicidal ideation.
One in 10 Canadians with arthritis had clinically relevant levels of major depression. The age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of major depression (OR 2.24, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 2.11-2.38) and suicidal ideation (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.75-2.31) among those with arthritis were approximately twice that of those without arthritis. The adjusted ORs of major depression among those with arthritis were significantly higher among women, the unmarried, younger, and poorer individuals. Individuals in pain, with limitations in activities of daily living, with limitations in instrumental activities of daily living, and with greater numbers of chronic conditions had higher odds of major depression. Less than half of those with major depression had consulted a mental health professional. One in 5 individuals with arthritis and major depression had been suicidal in the past year.
The majority of individuals with arthritis and major depression were not receiving adequate treatment for major depression. Clients should be screened for major depression and suicidal ideation, particularly if they fall into the identified vulnerable groups."
293,19405006,2009-05-01,Defining remission in rheumatoid arthritis: results of an initial American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism consensus conference.,N/A,"Due to advances in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) therapies over the last few years, an increasing proportion of patients are able to achieve a state of remission. However, the definition of remission is unclear. Currently, randomized controlled trials around the world use different remission definitions and consequently measure different aspects of a patient's disease state. The need for a uniform definition of remission is vital for research findings to be correctly interpreted.
The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) constituted a committee that included international clinical researchers, trialists, and clinical epidemiologists in order to redefine remission in RA. This group was asked to study current definitions of remission, explore the theoretical underpinning of the concept of remission, and develop a research agenda that would inform future work in the development of an ACR definition of remission.
In its first meeting, the committee preferred to develop a strict definition, implying no or very low disease activity. Such a definition would need to be validated against long-term outcome, e.g., physical function and damage.
The committee decided to consider both a definition for trials and a modified version for clinical practice. Since the first meeting, the ACR and the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) have decided to sponsor this initiative as an official ACR/EULAR collaboration."
294,19394781,2009-04-28,Whole-body MR imaging for patients with rheumatism.,N/A,"WB-MRI in rheumatic diseases is still an emerging imaging tool. So far, WB-MRI in rheumatism is mainly used in seronegative spondyloarthropathies. In these diseases it has the ability to visualize the majority of involved joints and soft tissue structures (both active inflammatory changes and chronic structural abnormalities) in one examination, making it suitable for imaging of different forms of spondylopathies, allowing different types of joint involvement to be recognized and assessing both the acute symptoms of disease and the longer-term consequences. Its role in daily practice is not yet clear. WB-MRI is not recommended as a first line investigation in every patient suffering from a form of spondyloarthropathy, but may add important information in difficult cases. Moreover, WB-MRI might obtain a stronger role in the early diagnosis of spondyloarthritides and in the assessment of treatment response. Other rheumatic diseases where WB-MRI may play a role in the future are polymyositis/dermatomyositis, CRMO and certain forms of systemic vasculitis. WB-MRI in rheumatism is a promising tool with great potential, however further systematic evaluation of its abilities and limitations in different forms of rheumatic diseases is awaited."

296,19076791,2008-12-17,Fibroblastic rheumatism.,N/A,"Fibroblastic rheumatism (FR) was first described in 1980 by Chaouat et al., and there have been few cases reported to date. The cause remains unknown. We report the first Latin-American patient with FR, to our knowledge, who is also the patient with the most striking dermatological features described in the literature. The diagnosis was based on the presence of a number of typical features. Clinically, the patient presented skin nodules and polyarthropathy with flexion contractures of the fingers. The histological findings compressed fibroblastic proliferation, thickened collagen fibres, dermal fibrosis and a decreased number of elastic fibres. Immunoreactivity for beta-catenin, alpha-smooth muscle actin and the monoclonal antibody HHF-35 showed myofibroblastic differentiation. Treatment with prednisone slightly reduced the number of nodules but did not improve the rheumatological symptoms. This condition has shown a poor response to many treatments proposed by previous authors. Further study will be necessary to identify effective treatment."
297,19050894,2008-12-04,A case of Poncet's disease (tuberculous rheumatism).,N/A,"We describe a 37-year-old woman with recurrent polyarthritis, and recurrent erythema nodosum on the flexible side of her left forearm. On an X-ray of the chest, infiltration of the right upper lobe was observed. Transcription-reverse transcription concerted reaction in sputum samples revealed Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tuberculosis). Resolution of the polyarthritis with anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs occurred in 3 days. We diagnosed her with Poncet's disease (PD). PD is considered to be a reactive arthritis, which is a different entity from tuberculous arthritis. Although PD is a rare disease, we should be aware of it as one of the differential diagnoses, even in patients without typical symptoms of TB."

In particular, the results of a web-based Delphi exercise aimed at selection of research questions and evidence from systematic literature research, as parts of the development of these recommendations, are presented in detail.
In agreement with the EULAR standard operating procedures a Task Force was created that consisted of the EUSTAR board members, 10 systemic sclerosis (SSc) experts invited from outside the EUSTAR board and representing Europe, the USA and Japan, a clinical epidemiologist, 2 patients with SSc and 3 fellows for literature research. All EUSTAR centres were invited to contribute to the development of recommendations through submission and preliminary selection of the research questions. The systematic literature research was performed using the Pubmed, Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases. Retrieved trials were evaluated according to the Jadad classification, and the level of evidence was graded from 1 to 4. Outcome data for efficacy and adverse events were abstracted and effect size, number needed to treat (NNT) and number needed to harm (NNH) were calculated when appropriate.
In all, 65 EUSTAR Centres provided 304 research questions concerning SSc treatment. These questions were aggregated, subdivided into 19 treatment categories and then subjected to preliminary selection by a web-based Delphi technique. The final set of 26 research questions was created by the Expert Committee based on the results of the Delphi exercise and the expert's experience.
This paper is a comprehensive summary of the methods we used to build recommendations for the drug treatment of systemic sclerosis, combining an evidence based approach and expert opinion."
299,18930989,2008-10-22,Influence of variants of Fc gamma receptors IIA and IIIA on the American College of Rheumatology and European League Against Rheumatism responses to anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha therapy in rheumatoid arthritis.,N/A,"Fc gamma receptor (Fc gammaR) polymorphism influences the affinity of the receptor for Ig, which may, in turn, affect the efficacy of Ig-based therapies. The relationship between functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of the FCGR2A and FCGR3A genes and the response to anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha therapy (infliximab) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) was assessed.
A total of 91 patients with RA (89% female; 76.7% rheumatoid factor (RF) positive) starting therapy with infliximab were evaluated at 0, 6 and 30 weeks using the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria and the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) was evaluated using three parameters, including C-reactive protein (CRP) (DAS28 3v-CRP) changes during the follow-up. Genotyping of FCGR2A-R131H and FCGR3A-F158V polymorphisms was performed by allele-specific PCR and PCR sequence-based typing, respectively. The chi(2) and Fisher exact tests were used to show differences in the outcome variables, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to analyse the evolution of DAS28 3v-CRP. A generalised linear models multivariable analysis was also performed.
At week 6 of follow-up, the proportion of patients achieving 50% improvement as per ACR criteria (ACR50) and EULAR good responses were significantly higher among homozygotes of the low affinity FCGR3A allele (FF: 24.1% and VV-VF:2.2%; p = 0.003 and FF: 44.8% and VV-VF: 22.9%; p = 0.040, respectively). At week 30, homozygotes of the low affinity FCGR2A allele had a better ACR20 response (RR: 60% and HH-RH: 33.3%; p = 0.035). Changes in DAS28 3v-CRP during follow-up were consistent with those observed in ACR and EULAR responses.
The response to anti-TNFalpha treatment with infliximab in patients with RA is influenced by the FCGR2A and FCGR3A genotypes. This effect is observed at different times in the follow-up (6 and 30 weeks, respectively) indicating the dynamic nature of the Fc gammaR versus Ig interaction."
300,18696403,2008-08-13,"[Is the guideline, ""Management of early rheumatoid arthritis,"" being followed in a rheumatism center?].",N/A,"There are indications that the influence of external guidelines on the quality of health care is limited and they are little or not at all used in clinical practice. It was the aim of this study to examine how and to what extent the external S3 guideline ""Management of Early Rheumatoid Arthritis"" was applied in a rheumatism center.
In accordance with the data of all rheumatoid arthritis patients, who were treated November 2007, an investigation was carried out on the degree of application and realization of the S3 guideline which had been changed into an internal guideline. The primary objective was the Disease Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drug (DMARD) therapy; secondary objectives were the administration of methotrexate with folic acid, the administration of glucocorticoids with calcium and vitamin D; and NSAR monotherapy.
94.6 % of the patients were given a therapy of basis drugs (DMARDs). 82.5 % of the methotrexate patients additionally received folic acid. 65.9 % of the patients received, in addition to glucocorticoids, calcium and vitamin D. In 99.1 % of the cases NSAR monotherapy was instituted.
The high degree of application does not correspond with the results of previous studies on guideline compliance with external guidelines. A possible explanation of this may be the change made of the external guideline to a guideline within the hospital."
301,18663450,2008-07-30,Magnetic resonance imaging of palindromic rheumatism.,N/A,"A 44-year-old man with intermittent asymmetric migratory oligoarthritis lasting the recent decade was admitted to our hospital. Considerable specific biomarkers for rheumatoid arthritis such as anti-agalactosyl IgG antibody are all negative. He was diagnosed as palindromic rheumatism (PR). Although hand X-rays showed no remarkable findings, hand magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected pannus and bone erosion. PR is defined as the disease characterized by short-lasting attacks of acute oligoarthritis, without radiographic changes. To our knowledge, the findings of MRI for PR have not been previously described. We propose that MRI findings in patients with PR is useful tool to distinguish PR from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other RA related diseases."
302,18597151,2008-07-04,Over the counter (OTC) oral remedies for arthritis and rheumatism: how effective are they?,N/A,"Increasingly patients resort to alternative remedies for arthritis and rheumatism, perhaps partly impelled by reports of toxicities from prescribed non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). There is uncertainty about whether the most common alternative treatments provide relief or may cause adverse reactions.
To ascertain the validity of manufacturers' claims permitted by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) in Australia for a range of self-medication products to treat the pain and inflammation of arthritis, available in local pharmacies, supermarkets or by mail order and in other countries.
OTC products were administered orally to rats in standard assays for suppressing experimental arthritis and fever and for determining potential gastrotoxicity.
The three NSAIDs available OTC were efficacious but gastrotoxic. Of the 37 herbal formulations examined, seven were as effective as ibuprofen in the anti-arthritic assay without causing gastric bleeding. Five of the 10 animal-sourced products tested were also effective without evident toxicity. Within a certain class of product, e.g. celery seed extracts or dried mussel preparations, efficacies ranged from almost zero to highly effective.
Consumers currently have no guide to the likely efficacy of TGA-approved remedies. Quality control is urgently needed to justify the veracity of TGA-permitted and other claims on product labels."

Data were analysed from two randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of abatacept of 6-month and 12-month duration in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response criteria and the proportion of patients in remission (DAS28 <2.6) based on the two DAS28 definitions were examined. Trends in radiographic progression (erosion score, joint space narrowing score and total score) and physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI)) across the EULAR responder states (none, moderate and good) were analysed.
There was general agreement in determining the EULAR responder state using both DAS28 definitions (kappa = 0.80, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.83). Overall, there was 82.4% agreement on the EULAR response criteria; when disagreements occurred, the DAS28 (CRP) yielded a better EULAR response more often then DAS28 (ESR) (12.6% vs 4.9%, respectively). There was also agreement in determining remission: kappa = 0.69 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.78). Radiographic progression decreased in patients treated with abatacept across EULAR states (from none to moderate to good) based on both definitions. For patients treated with placebo, the trend was not as pronounced, with radiographic scores higher for moderate vs non-responders. For physical function, similar trends were observed across the EULAR states for both DAS28 definitions.
The DAS28 (CRP) has been validated against radiographic progression and physical function. While the DAS28 (CRP) yielded a better EULAR response more often than the DAS28 (ESR), the validation profile was similar to the DAS28 (ESR), indicating that both measures are useful for assessing disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

He had intermittent fever and acute arthritis in several joints leading to hospitalization and enforced bed rest for 6 weeks. The details of his illness and its possible etiology are reviewed. Inflammatory rheumatism was a descriptive term within which several modern diagnoses might be included. Although it is not possible to identify Roosevelt's illness with any certainty, it was most compatible with polyarticular gout, although reactive arthritis, rheumatic fever, and several other diagnoses cannot be ruled out."

Problem areas and related keywords regarding the management of BD were determined by the multidisciplinary expert committee commissioned by EULAR for developing the recommendations. A systematic literature research was performed using MedLine and Cochrane Library resources through to December 2006. Meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), open studies, observational studies, case control studies and case series' involving > or = 5 patients were included. For each intervention the effect size and number needed to treat were calculated for efficacy. Odds ratios and numbers needed to harm were calculated for safety issues of different treatment modalities where possible.
The literature research yielded 137 articles that met the inclusion criteria; 20 of these were RCTs. There was good evidence supporting the use of azathioprine and cyclosporin A in eye involvement and interferon (IFN)alpha in mucocutaneous involvement. There were no RCTs with IFNalpha or tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha antagonists in eye involvement. Similarly controlled data for the management of vascular, gastrointestinal and neurological involvement is lacking.
Properly designed, controlled studies (new and confirmatory) are still needed to guide us in managing BD."

Three boys with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (JSLE) and juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) respectively, 3 to 6 years old with the mean age of 5 years with 3.5 to 22 months course of disease with 14 months on average, received auto-PBHSCT. Their conditions were so severe that conventional therapy failed to control the diseases. The changes of both clinical manifestations and immunologic indexes were observed before and after transplantation with long term following up at specialty clinic of rheumatism.
The time when neutrophil count >or= 0.5 x 10(9)/L in the 3 children was days +9, +13 and +11 respectively, that of platelet count >or= 20 x 10(9)/L was days +14, +18 and +13 respectively. The cellular immune function remained abnormal with CD4 cells at a low level and CD4/CD8 being inverted. As to the JDM child, the skin rash had disappeared and his muscle tone was improved to grade 5 within one month after the transplantation. The EMG and serum creatase level returned to normal and muscle MRI findings were improved greatly within 2 months after the transplantation. As to the JSLE child, skin rash and proteinuria had disappeared, MRI of brain showed that the pathological changes had been absorbed and EEG returned to normal 3 months after the transplantation, all the autoantibodies turned to negative within 8 months after transplantation. As to the JRA child, the arthritis had been improved remarkably within 3 weeks after auto-PBHSCT. There was no swelling of joints nor movement limitation 3 months post transplantation. The steroids and immunosuppressive drugs were discontinued post transplantation. Cushing syndrome disappeared. Their body heights increased by 10 to 15 cm in the past 18 months, and they all returned to school. There was no relapse during follow-up periods of 25 - 27 months.
The therapy with auto-PBHSCT for refractory rheumatism among preschool children was remarkably effective in a short-term, yet the safety and long-term effect still need to be further studied."

309,19562972,2008-01-01,[Soft tissue rheumatism in erderly].,N/A,"Disorders of soft, peri-articular tissues are a common cause of musculoskeletal pain in elderly patients. Nevertheless, most physicians underestimate the role of soft tissue rheumatism in the pathomechanism of the pain. The impairments of soft tissue can not be diagnosed by X-rays examinations, whereas degenerative lesions of joints are easy diagnosed using this method even despite of their uncertain role in producing the symptoms. The incidence of pain syndromes originated from soft tissues differ regarding to the age of patients. In young subjects the incidence of all of them is generally low. Syndromes provoked by overloading during work: repetitive strain syndrome, canal tunnel syndrome, tennis elbow, golfers elbow, shoulder tendon coin disorders and myofascial pain syndrome are common in middle-aged patients. The morbidity of fibromialgia syndrome is also lower in old people probably as the result of diminished numbers and degenerative changes in nociceptive fibers. The syndromes prevailing in elderly patients include trochanteric syndrome and the pain syndromes provoked by muscle spasm depended on posture abnormalities. In the soft tissue pain syndrome prevention adapted to old age kinesitherapy and avoiding muscle overloading are recommended. Soft tissue pain syndromes are usually treated with non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs. In local pain syndromes better results can be obtained by local treatment. Local injections of glikocorticosteroids are usually very effective and safe."

In 2001, a preliminary consensus-derived core set for evaluating response to therapy in juvenile DM was established. In the present study, the core set was validated through an evidence-based, large-scale data collection that led to the enrollment of 294 patients from 36 countries. Consecutive patients with active disease were assessed at baseline and after 6 months. The validation procedures included assessment of feasibility, responsiveness, discriminant and construct ability, concordance in the evaluation of response to therapy between physicians and parents, redundancy, internal consistency, and ability to predict a therapeutic response.
The following clinical measures were found to be feasible, and to have good construct validity, discriminative ability, and internal consistency; furthermore, they were not redundant, proved responsive to clinically important changes in disease activity, and were associated strongly with treatment outcome and thus were included in the final core set: 1) physician's global assessment of disease activity, 2) muscle strength, 3) global disease activity measure, 4) parent's global assessment of patient's well-being, 5) functional ability, and 6) health-related quality of life.
The members of the Paediatric Rheumatology International Trials Organisation, with the endorsement of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism, propose a core set of criteria for the evaluation of response to therapy that is scientifically and clinically relevant and statistically validated. The core set will help standardize the conduct and reporting of clinical trials and assist practitioners in deciding whether a child with juvenile DM has responded adequately to therapy."
311,18084698,2007-12-18,The effect of disease activity on fat-free mass and resting energy expenditure in patients with rheumatoid arthritis versus noninflammatory arthropathies/soft tissue rheumatism.,N/A,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic joint disease of undetermined cause that is associated with significant disability. Low-grade fever, anemia, and weight loss are recognized extra-articular features associated with increased disease activity. Weight loss and cachexia are well-established features of RA. The mechanism behind weight loss in RA is not known and may be multifactorial. Reduced energy intake and hypermetabolism are the major two factors frequently implicated in the etiology of RA cachexia. One would expect the effect of the above two factors to be highest during increased disease activity and lowest during remission. The purpose of this study was: (a) to establish whether in RA patients changes in body composition mirror changes in disease activity, (b) to investigate the relation between the energy expenditures and weight loss, (c) to examine the dietary energy intake and its role in weight loss in RA patients, and (d) to investigate the relation between the cytokine interleukin (IL)-6 and other variables including resting energy expenditure (REE), body composition, and acute phase reactants. Fourteen patients with RA were age-, sex-, and race-matched with 14 controls from patients with noninflammatory diseases/soft tissue rheumatism. The measurements included the following: disease activity assessment, anthropometric measurements, indirect calorimetry, and measurements of dietary intake. Blood was collected to measure the acute-phase reactants and IL-6 levels. We demonstrated that loss of fat-free mass (FFM) might accelerate during times of increased disease activity and is only partially restored during periods of reduced disease activity. This probably means that the extent of cachexia in RA patients is determined by the frequency and intensity of disease activity (flare) for a given disease duration. Hypermetabolism with increased REE was more evident during increased disease activity. Hypermetabolism in the face of increased energy intake continued to cause loss of the FFM. Interleukin-6 correlates with increased REE and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. There was no direct association between IL-6 level and low FFM. We conclude that loss of FFM is common in RA, cytokine production in RA is associated with altered energy metabolism, and preservation of FFM is important in maintaining good quality of life in patients with RA."
312,17971670,2007-11-01,[Study on the clinical effectiveness of electronically stored nosodes from tooth diseases and articular rheumatism on persons with rheumatic diseases].,N/A,"For about 15 years, one of the authors (JS) has successfully treated patients suffering from rheumatic diseases with individually tested and electronically stored nosodes from tooth diseases and articular rheumatism using exogenic MORA bioresonance therapy. Until today no human study has tested that kind of nosode therapy. The present, partially controlled study aims to test the effectiveness of that type of nosode therapy.
A partially placebo-controlled study was carried out on 15-21 participants (depending on the parameter) who suffered from rheumatic diseases. The main outcome parameter was the mean EAP(electro acupuncture)-40 value (controlled), i.e. the mean difference of the 40 final measured values from the norm of scale division 50. Secondary outcome parameters (not controlled) were the perceived state of health as well as biochemical, physicochemical and cellular parameters of the blood.
The mean EAP-40 value was significantly reduced (p < 0.01) by the verum treatment. The placebo treatment also yielded slight results but these were not significant (p > 0.05). The mean perceived state of health, the sedimentation of blood cells, the mean calcium value and the redox potential of the blood improved significantly (p < 0.01). The other parameters indicated no or only slight changes (p > 0.05).
The results suggest that therapy with electronically stored nosodes is effective in patients with rheumatic diseases."

We undertook a consensus-based, iterative process using two consecutive questionnaires sent to 29 senior ultrasonographer rheumatologists who comprised the faculty of the 14th EULAR ultrasound course (June 2007). The first questionnaire encompassed the following issues: type of MSUS educational model; course timing; course curriculum; course duration; number of participants per teacher in practical sessions; time spent on hands-on sessions; and the requirements and/or restrictions for attendance at the courses. The second questionnaire consisted of questions related to areas where consensus had not been achieved in the first questionnaire, and to the topics and pathologies to be assigned to different educational levels.
The response rate was 82.7% from the first questionnaire and 87.5% from the second questionnaire. The respondents were from 11 European countries. The group consensus on guidelines and curriculum was for a three-level education model (basic, intermediate and advanced) with timing and location related to the annual EULAR Congresses. The topics and pathologies to be included in each course were agreed. The course duration will be 20 h. There will be a maximum of six participants per teacher and 50-60% of total time will be spent on practical sessions. There was also agreement on prerequisite experience before attending the intermediate and advanced courses.
We have developed European agreed guidelines for the content and conduct of EULAR ultrasound courses, which may also be recommended to national and local MSUS training programmes."
314,17911225,2007-10-04,Outcomes from studies of antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody associated vasculitis: a systematic review by the European League Against Rheumatism systemic vasculitis task force.,N/A,"We undertook a systematic literature review as a background to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for conducting clinical trials in anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody associated vasculitis (AAV), and to assess the quality of evidence for outcome measures in AAV.
Using a systematic Medline search, we categorised the identified studies according to diagnoses. Factors affecting remission, relapse, renal function and overall survival were identified.
A total of 44 papers were reviewed from 502 identified by our search criteria. There was considerable inconsistency in definitions of end points. Remission rates varied from 30% to 93% in Wegener granulomatosis (WG), 75% to 89% in microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and 81% to 91% in Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). The 5-year survival for WG, MPA and CSS was 74-91%, 45-76% and 60-97%. Relapse (variably defined) was common in the first 2 years but the frequency varied: 18% to 60% in WG, 8% in MPA, and 35% in CSS. The rate of renal survival in WG varied from 23% at 15 months to 23% at 120 months.
used to assess morbidity varied between studies. Ignoring the variations in definitions of the stage of disease, factors influencing remission, relapse, renal and overall survival included immunosuppressive therapy used, type of organ involvement, presence of ANCA, older age and male gender.
Factors influencing remission, relapse, renal and overall survival include the type of immunosuppressive therapy used, pattern of organ involvement, presence of ANCA, older age and male gender. Methodological variations between studies highlight the need for a consensus on terminology and definitions for future conduct of clinical studies in AAV."
315,17891407,2007-09-25,[European League Against Rheumatism evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and management of gout].,N/A,"Gout cannot be regarded a benign disease, as it is unfortunately often misunderstood. In view of the lack of recent evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of gout, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) decided to commission a task force to develop such recommendations. A literature search was performed to comprehensively assess the clinical and epidemiological aspects, diagnostic tools, as well as effectiveness of therapeutic measures and the overall management. Subsequently, consensus among the participating experts should be achieved by applying a Delphi process. As a result of this project 10 recommendations for diagnosis of gout as well as 12 recommendations with respect to the management of the disease could be elaborated. Gout can be regarded as a disease with excellent prognosis in the light of the diagnostic and therapeutic possibilities available. However, this only holds true if all these possibilities are applied in the appropriate manner in daily routine. It constituted the primary goal of the EULAR project to deliver a substantial contribution to improve routine care of affected patients."
316,17763205,2007-09-01,TNF receptor I polymorphism is associated with persistent palindromic rheumatism.,N/A,"To investigate the association between tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), TNF receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFRSF1A, also known as TNFRI), TNFRSF1B (TNFRII), and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and the susceptibility to persistent palindromic rheumatism (PR).
Fifty-six unrelated patients with persistent PR and 100 unrelated healthy controls were genotyped for TNFalpha -308G/A, -238G/A, and +488G/A, TNFRSF1A -609G/T and +36A/G, TNFRSF1B +676T/G and +1663G/A, and IL-1beta -511C/T, -31T/C, and +3954C/T using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
The TNFRSF1A +36G allele [odds ratio (OR) = 3.94, p = 0.003, corrected p (p(c)) = 0.03] and the TNFRSF1A +36AG genotype (OR = 4.81, p = 0.002, p(c) = 0.04) were significantly associated with persistent PR. The frequency of TNFRSF1B +676T/+1663A was increased in PR patients (OR = 2.12, p = 0.01), but failed to reach statistical significance after Bonferroni correction. No correlation was observed between persistent PR and TNFalpha, TNFRSF1A -609G/T, or IL-1beta SNPs.
The results of this study provide evidence of an association between persistent PR and SNPs within the TNFRSF1A gene, and suggest that TNFRI is involved in the aetiopathogenesis of PR."
317,17665427,2007-08-01,An unexpectedly high frequency of MEFV mutations in patients with anti-citrullinated protein antibody-negative palindromic rheumatism.,N/A,"To investigate whether the MEFV gene, which is involved in the regulation of the inflammatory response and has been associated with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) and intermittent hydrarthrosis, is implicated in the pathogenesis of palindromic rheumatism (PR) and to examine its clinical presentation and its evolution in a Spanish cohort of PR patients.
Family histories, demographic clinical data, and laboratory characteristics of 75 patients diagnosed as having PR were collected from medical records and personal interviews. The healthy control group included 325 blood bank donors. The FMF control group was made up of 84 Spanish FMF patients. Genomic DNA was isolated, and MEFV gene mutation analysis was performed by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequence analysis.
Sixty-five unrelated PR patients were finally included in the study. MEFV gene mutation analysis identified 8 of these 65 patients (12.3%) as carriers of at least 1 mutated MEFV allele. Patients with MEFV mutations had higher mean age and age at disease onset, but lower mean serum levels of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs). No other significant differences were observed between patients with and those without mutations. The frequency of MEFV mutations in ACPA-negative PR patients was 22.2%, compared with 5.3% in ACPA-positive PR patients (P = 0.058).
This study shows a previously unreported high prevalence of mutations of the MEFV gene in patients with ACPA-negative PR. This supports the hypothesis that it might be a susceptibility gene. Our findings also support the hypothesis that the MEFV gene might participate in the pathogenesis of other undifferentiated relapsing inflammatory rheumatic disorders."
318,17505252,2007-05-17,Chikungunya infection: an emerging rheumatism among travelers returned from Indian Ocean islands. Report of 47 cases.,N/A,"A large chikungunya virus (CHIKV) outbreak emerged in 2005-2006 in the Indian Ocean islands, including Comoros, Mayotte, Mauritius, the Seychelles, and particularly in Reunion Island where 35% of 770,000 inhabitants were infected in 6 months. More recently, circulation of the virus has been documented in Madagascar and in India where CHIKV is spreading rapidly. CHIKV-infected visitors have returned home to nonendemic regions from these islands. We conducted a 14-month prospective observational study on the clinical aspects of CHIKV infection imported to Marseilles, France, in travelers returning from the Indian Ocean islands. A total of 47 patients have been diagnosed with imported CHIKV infection confirmed by serology, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and/or viral culture. At the early stage of the disease (within 10 days of the disease onset), fever was present in 45 of 47 patients. A rash was present in the first week in 25 cases. All patients suffered with arthritis. The most frequently affected joints were fingers, wrists, toes, and ankles. Eight patients were hospitalized during the acute stage, including 2 severe life-threatening cases. A total of 38 patients remained symptomatic after the tenth day with chronic peripheral rheumatism, characterized by severe joint pain and multiple tenosynovitis, with a dramatically limited ability to ambulate and carry out activities in daily life. Three patients were hospitalized at this stage for severe persistent handicap. Follow-up demonstrated slow improvement in joint pain and stiffness despite symptomatic treatment, mainly antiinflammatory and analgesic drugs. In the current series we describe 2 stages of the disease, an initial severe febrile and eruptive polyarthritis, followed by disabling peripheral rheumatism that can persist for months. We point out the possibility of transitory peripheral vascular disorders during the second stage and the occasional benefit of short-term corticosteroids. As CHIKV could spread throughout the world, all physicians should be prepared to encounter this arboviral infection."
319,17330294,2007-03-03,The Pediatric Rheumatology European Society/American College of Rheumatology/European League against Rheumatism provisional classification criteria for juvenile systemic sclerosis.,N/A,"To develop criteria for the classification of systemic sclerosis (SSc) in children (juvenile SSc).
The study consisted of 3 phases: 1) collection of data on the signs and symptoms of actual patients with juvenile SSc that are useful for defining involvement of a particular organ; 2) selection of the parameters essential for the classification of juvenile SSc and preparation of a set of provisional classification criteria (PCC) using 2 Delphi surveys; 3) consensus conference consisting of 2 steps: discussion and rating of clinical profiles of 160 patients with definite juvenile SSc, possible juvenile SSc, or other fibrosing diseases as ""having or not having juvenile SSc,"" using nominal group technique, and defining those PCC with the best statistical performance and highest face validity by using the clinical profiles of patients with definite juvenile SSc as the gold standard.
In phase 1, 55 centers submitted clinical data on 153 patients with juvenile SSc. A total of 48 signs and symptoms were derived from these patient data and were used to define 9 organ system categories (cutaneous, vascular, gastrointestinal, respiratory, renal, cardiac, neurologic, musculoskeletal, and serologic). During phase 2, these were reduced to 21 criteria (3 major criteria [Raynaud's phenomenon, proximal skin sclerosis/induration of the skin, and sclerodactyly] and 18 minor criteria) and combined to generate 86 different PCC. At the consensus conference, these 86 definitions were tested on the case profiles of 127 patients with juvenile SSc. The PCC with the highest ranking were proximal sclerosis/induration and at least 2 minor criteria.
These provisional classification criteria for juvenile SSc will help standardize the conduct of clinical research, epidemiologic and outcome studies, and therapeutic trials."

A 45-year-old man presented with peripheral vascular disease, polyarthralgia and subcutaneous nodules. The diagnosis of FR was confirmed by histological examination of a biopsy sample of a nodule, which showed myofibroblast proliferation. Radiographs of both hands showed bilateral erosion of the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints, of the right trapezium bone and acro-osteolysis of the third phalanx of the right-hand second finger.
Although the clinical features of FR have now been well described, the literature includes few radiological descriptions. In most reported cases, radiographs are normal at disease onset. Joint radiographs performed later usually show bone destruction of the hands and feet."

The binding kinetics of R-125224 was also determined, using isolated human synovial cells.
Tissue distribution was assessed at 1, 24 and 168 h after intravenous administration of (125)I-R-125224 to SCID-HuRAg mice (0.4 mg/kg). The in vitro binding of (125)I-R-125224 to isolated human synovial cells was investigated.
After intravenous administration of (125)I-R-125224 to SCID-HuRAg mice, the radioactivity distributed to various tissues at 1 h. Thereafter, the radioactivity in the tissues gradually decreased except for the transplanted synovial tissues, in which the radioactivity increased in a time-dependent manner, and at 168 h, the tissue/plasma concentration ratio was about 1. The in vitro binding affinity of (125)I-R-125224 to human synovial cells was high with a dissociation constant of 1.32 +/- 0.62 nM and the binding was inhibited by non-labeled R-125224 in a concentration-dependent manner.

This is a retrospective analysis of patients who had received HSCT for vasculitic diseases and have been reported to the European League Against Rheumatism autoimmune disease or European Bone Marrow Transplantation ProMISe databases. Information about the disease and outcome was obtained by a questionnaire sent to the referring centres. Response of the disease to HSCT was defined as partial or complete responses according to the ability to reduce immunosuppression after HSCT. In addition, the Medline database was searched for reports on HSCT in patients with vasculitis.
Detailed information was obtained for 15 patients, whose median age at HSCT was 37 years. The diagnoses were cryoglobulinaemia in four patients, Behçet's disease in three patients, Wegener's granulomatosis in three patients, and undifferentiated vasculitis, Churg-Strauss angiitis, polychondritis, Takayasu arteritis and polyarteritis nodosa in one patient each. 14 patients received autologous HSCT and 1 an allogeneic HSCT as the first transplant. In three patients, further transplantation was given because of relapse. The overall response, including all consecutive transplantations (HSCT/patient, n = 1-3, median 1.3) to HSCT, was 93%, with 46% complete responses and 46% partial responses; median (range) duration of response at the time of reporting was 45 (16-84) months. Three patients died, one from advanced disease, one from cancer and one from graft-versus-host disease. The Medline search showed five other patients who were effectively treated with HSCT for vasculitic diseases.
This retrospective study suggests that autologous HSCT is feasible for vasculitis. Its value remains to be tested in prospective controlled studies."
323,16891927,2006-08-08,Fibroblastic rheumatism.,N/A,"We report the first known South African case of fibroblastic rheumatism, a rare dermatoarthropathy. Our patient presented with the typical clinical features of a sudden-onset, erosive polyarthritis with cutaneous nodules and sclerodactyly. Significant functional loss occurred within a period of 3 to 4 months. X-rays of the hands showed a single erosion, whereas magnetic resonance imaging showed further erosions as well as soft tissue and synovial enhancement. The unique histologic findings of fibroblastic proliferation, thickened collagen, and dermal fibrosis confirmed the diagnosis of fibroblastic rheumatism. Our patient was treated with a combination of methotrexate and oral prednisolone with subsequent resolution of her synovitis/arthritis and no further progression of her sclerodactyly and associated functional loss. The course of fibroblastic rheumatism is known to vary and although multiple therapeutic options have been tried, the question remains whether any of the therapies alters the natural course of the disease. However, considering the probable role of lymphocytes and fibrogenic cytokines, an increased awareness with early diagnosis and treatment in the initial inflammatory stage may prevent the development of incapacitating joint sequelae."
324,16847371,2006-07-19,Examination of IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP Ab) in Japanese patients with palindromic rheumatism.,N/A,"We have studied the serology of 6 patients with palindromic rheumatism. None of the patients fulfilled the classification criteria for rheumatoid arthritis at the entry; however, 4 out of the 6 patients were seropositive for IgM rheumatoid factor (IgM-RF) at entry. Sequential serological study was performed in 4 patients; IgM-RF changed from seronegative to seropositive in one patient, and the titer increased in another patient. Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP Ab) at the entry was detected in only one of the 6 patients; that patient later developed RA. Although follow-up is necessary, the present study may suggest the importance of serological examination, especially anti-CCP Ab, in patients with palindromic rheumatism."

A possible complication in juvenile psoriatic rheumatism.,N/A,"The authors present a rare case of bilateral temporomandibular joint ankylosis secondary to polyarticular juvenile psoriatic arthritis in a 24 year-old man. The patient first presented with arthritis of his right elbow joint at the age of 9, followed by involvement of the distal inter-phalangeal joints of his right foot and both sacroiliac joints. Serum rheumatoid factor was not detected. At the age of 16 he developed psoriatic lesions affecting his nails and skin. By the age of 20, clinical and radiological evidence of arthritis was detected in his temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Subsequently, the patient developed bilateral TMJ ankylosis over a period of 4 years. The patient was managed by bilateral resection of the ankylosis bone blocks, mobilization of the mandible and interposition of Dacron material between the two neo-articular surfaces. 10 months postoperatively the patient maintained an inter-incisal distance of 3 cm. Postoperative mechano-therapy was hindered by the limited use of the patients' hands."

The data were collected using a structured questionnaire consisting of background variables and questions concerning verbal, behavioural and outcome empowerment. The questionnaire was sent to all members of the multidisciplinary team at the Rheumatism Foundation Hospital, with the exception of physicians, departmental secretaries and administrative personnel. The response rate was 58%. The data were examined using statistical methods. The multidisciplinary team felt quite strong verbal and behavioural empowerment, but was less confident in terms of outcome empowerment. Several factors were found to be associated with the different fields of empowerment. In conclusion, the multidisciplinary team felt quite strong work-related empowerment."
329,16432689,2006-01-25,[Instability of the upper cervical spine due to rheumatism].,N/A,"Rheumatic manifestation at the cervical spine occurs in more than 50% of all cases in the natural course of this disease. The first cervical manifestation takes place in the upper cervical spine. The initial involvement of the C1/C2 segment leads to atlantodental subluxation. Progressive destruction can result in vertical instability, which is characterized by cranial subluxation of the odontoid process with the danger of resulting stenosis and cervical myelopathy. The goal of diagnosis has to be the early recognition of these changes to establish an effective treatment protocol. Persistent pain, neurological deficits, and progressive radiological signs for instability are indications for operative stabilizing procedures. These procedures avoid progressive destruction and improve the prognosis regarding pain decrease, regression of neurological deficits, and life expectancy."

331,16338212,2005-12-13,"2nd conference on heart, rheumatism and autoimmunity, Pescara, Italy, May 19-20, 2005.",N/A,"Systemic autoimmune diseases, which comprise a family of conditions which share common pathogenetic mechanisms, are frequently associated to cardiac involvement and to a high prevalence of ischemic coronary events often occurring at a younger age than in normal population. A large increase in mortality is related to premature atherosclerosis with coronary artery disease and stroke in patients with connective tissue diseases. Coronary heart disease is responsible for 40-50% of the death of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, a growing body of evidence supports the view that autoimmune mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Inflammatory heart disease is a rising concern worldwide. Similar mechanisms link autoimmune diseases, including the association of increased disease with proinflammatory cytokines and the importance of regulatory mechanisms in the control of chronic inflammation. The role of the immune system in modulating atherosclerosis has recently been well documented. Studies have revealed that cellular and humoral immunity plays crucial roles in atherogenic plaque formation. This includes macrophages, CD4+ T cells and dendritic cells as well as autoantigens such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), heat shock proteins and beta2-glycoprotein I. The inflammatory component is not localized to the ""culprit"" plaque, but it is diffused to the entire coronary vascular bed, and involves also the myocardium. The aim of the conference (2nd conference on heart, rheumatism and autoimmunity) was to focus the attention of the participants on some pathogenetic, clinical and therapeutic aspects at the boundary between cardiology and rheumatology and to encourage the debate among clinicians and basic researchers with different backgrounds and experiences."

To understand their cumulative risk factors and antecedents, a chronic disease databank consisting of time-oriented, multidisciplinary longitudinal data, prospectively collected on consecutive patients and describing their clinical courses, provides a systematic anthology of patient reported outcome (PRO) data. ARAMIS, which began in the mid-1970s, was the first large-scale chronic disease data bank system. Outcomes data are collected using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), a well established PRO instrument that collects patient-centered data in the areas of disability, pain and other symptoms, adverse effects of treatment, economic impact, and mortality. More than 900 peer-reviewed studies have emanated from ARAMIS since its inception. In the earlier days, and even today, ARAMIS had to invent its own tools for the study of these new sciences. ARAMIS has made dominant contributions to the understanding of PROs and to helping improve treatment and health outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), scleroderma, lupus, aging, and drug side effects. It continues to traverse terrain with participation in the NIH ""Roadmap"" project, the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS). PROMIS is designed to provide improved assessment of health status across all chronic illnesses as part of an improved infrastructure for clinical research. As initiator of the rich history of chronic disease data banks with ""rolling"" consecutive open patient cohorts, ARAMIS has enabled the study of real-world PROs in rheumatology, with a wealth of resultant improved approaches to treatment, outcome, cost effectiveness, and quality of life."

The medical histories of the patients were reviewed with special emphasis on age, gender, duration of PR, and lapse of time until antiphospholipid antibodies were detected or APS was diagnosed. Three representative cases are described.
Two patients were women and four were men. Their mean age was 49.3 years (range 36-80), and the mean duration of PR was 5.5 years (range 3-8). In all patients, raised titers of antiphospholipid antibodies were found on two or more occasions. Two patients developed clinical pictures compatible with APS, two showed symptoms which may be attributable for APS, and raised titers of antiphospholipid antibodies were found in only two.
It seems that the appearance of these two uncommon conditions together is more than coincidental and may point to a previously unreported clinical association."

In psoriatic rheumatism: too many risks, too little efficacy.",N/A,"(1) The severity of joint involvement in psoriatic rheumatism varies greatly and its outcome is difficult to predict; some patients have long-term spontaneous remissions. The best-evaluated slow-acting treatments are sulfasalazine and methotrexate; adding etanercept can help some patients who do not respond to these drugs. (2) Leflunomide, an immunosuppressant drug, is already marketed for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, a condition for which it shows a less favourable risk-benefit balance than methotrexate. (3) Leflunomide is now licensed in France for ""active psoriatic rheumatism"". (4) The only available clinical data come from a double-blind placebo-controlled trial in 190 patients. On the basis of a combined outcome measure, significantly more patients responded to leflunomide than to placebo (59% versus 29.7%). However, the patients' global assessment was less positive: 15.8% of patients felt their condition had deteriorated during leflunomide therapy, compared to 24.2% of patients in the placebo group. The study population was too heterogeneous to show which types of patients might benefit most from leflunomide therapy. (5) Pharmacovigilance studies have confirmed some severe adverse effects (hepatic, cutaneous and haematological) and have uncovered other previously unrecognised effects such as interstitial pneumonia, hypertension, weight loss, and peripheral neuropathies. (6) In France, leflunomide treatment costs nearly 10 times more than methotrexate. (7) We conclude that leflunomide should not be used to treat psoriatic rheumatism."

Alkaptonuria was always confirmed by urinary homogentisic acid determination. Four different mutations of the HGD gene were found: an homozygous missense mutation, Serine189Isoleucine in two sisters with a mild phenotype; an homozygous splice site mutation (IVS1-1G > A) in a man with a severe phenotype (death at 61 years old from renal failure); a silent mutation, Alanine470Alanine at the heterozygous state in a man with a mild phenotype; a 'G' deletion at the position c.819 which causes a frameshift after Gly217(Gly217fs) that runs into a stop codon at c. 850. This mutation is novel and was found in heterozygosis in a woman with a mild phenotype.
The two homozygous mutations were associated, respectively, with a severe and a mild phenotype but no genotype-phenotype correlation could be found."

Stained smear, culture and PCR results of the synovial fluid for mycobacteria were negative. The patients were diagnosed with Poncet's disease. Polyarthritis was resolved rapidly with anti-tuberculosis treatment. We suggest that in cases with unexplained arthritis and non-articular TB, Poncet's disease should be considered. PCR can be used in the routine diagnostic algorithm when conventional methods fail to identify MTC."
338,15984580,2005-06-30,[A NSAID-associated alimentary tract disease in patients with rheumatism in Russia].,N/A,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence and character of non-steroid antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)-associated pathology in patients with rheumatic diseases (RD) in the Russian population. The study included questioning of 2537 RD patients (81% women and 19% men, mean age 55.8 +/- 14.2 years) who were taking NSAID, in 6 regions of Russia, between the October of 2003 and April of 2004. The results were analyzed using chi2 criterion, Fisher exact test, and Student t-criterion. 7.6% of the questioned and 14.7% of their relatives had ulcerous background [corrected] history (ulcers diagnosted prior to the beginning of treatment with NSAID). Most patients (70.1%) were taking non-selective NSAID (NSNSAID), chiefly diclophenac (50.9%). The most often used non-selective cyclooxygenasa-2 (COG-2) inhibitor was nimesulid, taken by 23.5% of the patients. 20.2% of patients were not aware of the influence of NSAID on the gastric and intestinal mucosa. 33.7% of the patients underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGDS) while taking NSAID. In 8.8% of the examined gastric or duodenal ulcers were found while they were taking NSAID; 1.5% of the examined developed gastro-duodenal hemorrhage or ulcer perforation. 53.1% of the questioned had gastroduodenal complaints; in most cases it was heartburn (37.3%), ""heaviness"" in the epigastral area (37.4%), and meteorism (37.4%). 51.3% of the patients associated gastroesopagial reflux and dyspepsia symptoms with intake of NSAID. 26.9% of the questioned associated stool disturbances and meteorism with NSAID intake. 32% of the patients took medications to eliminate gastrointestinal disorder symptoms. Patients taking selective COG-2 inhibitors had complaints less frequently than those who were taking NSNSAID (p = 0). Most frequently complaints were associated with intake of glucocorticoids (p = 0), low doses of aspirin (p = 0), smoking (p = 0), and elderly age (p = 0.007). Appearance of complaints was not associated with the dose of NSAID (diclophenac) (p = 0.257). 8.8% of the patients with ulcerous background were not aware of the effects of NSAID on the alimentory tract; 34.1% of the patients din not undergo EGDS withing the period of treatment with NSAID. Only 40.3% of patients were taking selective COG-2 inhibitors; 54.7% of patients were taking gastroprotective preparations. Alimentary tract pathology is a prevalent complication of therapy with NSAID in the Russian population. The most frequent gastrointestinal symptoms are subjective; they affect life quality substantially. Their risk factors are: elderly age, ulcer background, and glucocorticoid intake. Russian doctors do not take sufficient measures to prevent serious NSAID intake complications."
339,15965815,2005-06-21,[The treatment of juvenile rheumatism: pharmacotherapy].,N/A,"The treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis has changed a great deal in the last few years. Pharmacomedical treatment, physiotherapy and teaching the patients and parents are the mainstays of successful therapy. Using all available treatment options and thanks to new therapeutic options (TNFalpha-blockade) and due to a better understanding of the pathogenesis, individual therapeutic strategies provide adequate disease control in the large majority of cases. According to the subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis, different medications are used in combination with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) which are used initially. Methotrexate (MTX) and steroids in various applications are the drugs of choice for the systemic and polyarticular courses; intraarticular steroids, sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine for the oligoarticular subtype. The new option of TNFalpha-blockade (Etanercept, Infliximab, Adalimumab) offers significant clinical benefit in patients with polyarticular involvement, who do not respond to MTX. Further biological agents (Anakinra, Abatacept, Atlizumab) are used in children and adolescents in clinical studies. Rarely azathioprine, cyclosporine A, leflunomide and cyclophosphamide are used. Stem cell transplantation has been tried as a very last resort but interpretation of the results is controversial. Due to the improvement of the therapeutic options, the approaches to the patients and their disease has changed and cautious optimism is justified."
340,15756497,2005-03-10,[Liver and rheumatism].,N/A,"There are multiple relations between rheumatic diseases and the liver, nevertheless the liver is extremely rare involved in rheumatic diseases. ""Elevated liver enzymes"" are quite often found in patients who are under the medication with immunosuppressive drugs or/and non-steroidal antirheumatics. The most frequent cause for ""elevated liver enzymes"" are toxic and allergic side effects of drugs; however, in rare cases it might be extremely helpful to examine, whether an independent liver disease exists. Underlying liver diseases which might be associated with the rheumatic disorder or exist accidentally may change the therapeutic management of the patient. If the liver disease present can cause the rheumatic disorder (e. g. virus-induced vasculitis, hemochromatosis), a specific hepatological therapy should precede the immunosuppression."

Experiments were made on rats with swelling foot induced by carrageenin; experiments were made on mice with swelling ear induced by xylol; experiments were made on rats with chronic granuloma; experiments were made on rats with adjuvant arthritis.
Foot swelling induced by carrageenin could be diminished with crude and processed Herba Siegesbeckiae at 6.0, 2.0 g x kg(-1). The rate of inhibition of foot swelling was more than 40%, effect of the crude drug was better than that of the processed one; both of them at 6.0, 2.0 g x kg(-1) could protect rats from primary and continuous lesion of adjuvant arthritis. The effect of the processed herb was obviously better than that of the crude one in its starting minute, strength and sustaining time.
The processed Herba Siegesbeckiae has obvious inhibition effect on immune inflammation. It is better than the crude Herb. Both of them have obvious inhibition effect on inflammation caused by carrageenin, with no distinct difference."
342,15693099,2005-02-05,What is the impact of adolescent arthritis and rheumatism? Evidence from a national sample of Canadians.,N/A,"Adolescent arthritis or rheumatism (AAR) has been shown to influence the activities, mental health, and healthcare utilization of affected individuals. However, these effects have never been estimated in a population-based sample. We examined the association of AAR with health status, health services use, health behaviors, and activity limitations. We also investigated the effect of socioeconomic status and family background on respondents with AAR.
The 1996 National Population Health Survey is a nationally representative survey exploring the health status and behaviors of Canadians. Among the 26,012 individuals aged 12 to 19 with complete responses on the presence of chronic illnesses, the 213 self-reporting arthritis or rheumatism (AAR) were compared to: (1) all other adolescents as a single group; or (2) the group of 9161 adolescents reporting other chronic diseases (OCD) but not AAR, and the group of 16,638 adolescents without chronic disease (WCD). Between-group differences were examined for the following variables: health status; use of health services; presence of activity limitations in school, work, or at home; and school enrollment and work status.
Compared to those without, respondents with AAR reported more diagnoses of non-AAR chronic illnesses. Depression among AAR individuals was more prevalent than among non-AAR individuals, as was suffering from moderate or severe pain. Those with AAR were more likely than WCD individuals to use physician services, hospital services, and pain relief medications. AAR patients were more likely to be limited in their activities, and less likely to be enrolled in school than OCD or WCD individuals.
This study indicates a broad range of effects of AAR in a nationally representative sample. Arthritis or rheumatism affected measures of mental health, health service use, and the school, work, and home activities of affected individuals, compared to individuals without chronic disease or with other chronic disease."
343,15454124,2004-09-30,Palindromic rheumatism and other relapsing arthritis.,N/A,"Patients with recurrent or relapsing arthritis are frequently seen in rheumatological practice. Besides crystal arthritis, the most frequent cause of recurrent arthritis, there are several diseases that may present clinically as intermittent mono- or polyarthritis. Palindromic rheumatism is the paradigm of this type of condition, but other diseases such as systemic autoinflammatory disorders (periodic fever syndromes), Whipple's disease, arthritis associated with hyperlipidemia, intermittent hydrarthrosis and other diseases should be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of patients with recurrent arthritis. In this chapter, we discuss recent developments in these diseases with special emphasis on palindromic rheumatism, a common condition whose close relationship with rheumatoid arthritis remains intriguing."

Inflammatory signs or systemic manifestations may be lacking in these disorders. Fibrositis, bursitis, tenosynovitis, myositis are some of the common types of soft tissue rheumatism. The disorders can be classified broadly into two groups ie, diffuse and local. Proper history taking and performing detailed examination are very important in arriving at diagnosis. Management includes pain relief by suitable measures. In fibromyalgia diffuse musculoskeletal pain is observed having at least 11 or 18 tender points involving upper and lower body bilaterally."
345,15049603,2004-03-31,[Psoriatic rheumatism].,N/A,"Five to 7% of patients with cutaneous psoriasis suffer from inflammatory rheumatism that is sero-negative for rheumatoid factor, and is often erosive. The inflammation is predominant to the entheses and can affect the axial or peripheral skeleton, often in an associated manner. The most common peripheral signs are those of an asymmetrical oligo-arthritis type, and the most evocative are arthritis of the distal inter-phalangeal joints. A symmetrical polyarthritis can also be observed. The severe mutilating forms are fortunately very rare. Axial signs include sacro-iliitis that is more often bilateral and spinal involvement of an ankylosing spondyloarthitic type, predominating in the cervical and thoracic spine. The treatment usually calls for a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and local injection of cortisone. Steroids must be used with care and reserved for the severe forms. DMARDS include Salazopyrin, methotrexate, and in the severe and resistant forms, the inhibitors of TNFalpha."

A heat wave and a somewhat substandard venue hampered some of the activities, notably the poster sessions. The scientific program was comprehensive and of a high class, and it was organized in 10-12 parallel sessions. The European League Against Rheumatism standing committees are expanding their activities and stimulating European cooperation (e.g. by creating databases and guidelines, and by starting research programs). The standing committees presented several areas where European cooperative work is in progress. Advances in drug therapy were a prominent theme and were well presented. Commercialism remains a problem for this meeting as for other similar large meetings, where satellite symposia surround the scientific program of the congress and often duplicate this."

We examined the prevalence of LTPA and its association to generalized distress among Canadians with rheumatic conditions.
The 1996-97 National Population Health Survey interview data from respondents with rheumatic conditions (n = 10,700) and persons with no chronic conditions (n = 19791) in the same age range (20-79 yrs) were selected for analyses. Self-reported data on forms and frequency of LTPA engaged in over the past 3 months were collected. Intensity of LTPA was expressed as total energy expenditure, with respondents classified as Active (> or = 3.0 kcal/kg/day), Moderate (1.5-2.9 kcal/kg/day), and Inactive (< 1.5 kcal/kg/day). Generalized distress was assessed using a subset of items from the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
Similar to persons with no chronic conditions, roughly 56% of persons with rheumatic conditions engaged in regular LTPA (12 or more 15-minute sessions per month). Only 13.2% of women and 18.9% of men with rheumatic conditions were sufficiently active at the level recommended to yield optimal health benefits. Both moderate and higher intensity LTPA was associated with less generalized distress. This relationship was more pronounced for women and for middle-aged and older patients with rheumatic conditions.
A significant proportion of Canadians with rheumatic conditions are physically inactive. Even moderate intensity LTPA is associated with decreased generalized distress. Better efforts must be directed at promoting LTPA as part of the multidisciplinary management of this condition."

Guidelines that use a strictly evidence-based approach are less likely to incur bias than those that rely more on expert consensus. Although expert consensus is useful in areas in which there are little trial data, clear delineation should be made between evidence-based statements and expert opinion. Following the dissemination of guidelines for the management of OA, emphasis should now be placed on discussion and implementation of the recommendations and subsequent revision of guidelines as new evidence comes to light."
350,14598662,2003-11-06,[A case of Poncet's disease (tuberculous rheumatism) in a patient with chronic renal failure undergoing hemodialysis therapy].,N/A,"A 78-year-old man who was undergoing hemodialysis therapy was admitted to our hospital because of sore throat, remittent cervical lymphadenopathy, and polyarthritis over the preceding 4 weeks. On admission, he had bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy. He complained of arthralgia associated with tenderness, warmth and swelling of both elbows, left side wrist and left shoulder joint. The C-reactive protein level on admission was 15.3 mg/dl. Rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibodies, tuberculin skin test and blood culture were negative. Joint fluid was not aspirated. Radiographs of the joints did not reveal any abnormalities. Acid-fast bacilli were demonstrated in the smear of the cervical lymph node with a fluorochrome rhodamine-auramine stain. Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA was identified by polymerase chain reaction. We found the presence of caseating granuloma on the biopsy specimens and M.tuberculosis was detected from culture. At that point, we diagnosed this patient as having tuberculous lymphadenitis. His general symptoms resolved rapidly after starting with a three-drug regimen consisting of isoniazid, rifampin and pyrazinamide. His polyarthritis also improved dramatically. Finally we considered that his polyarthritis was tuberculous rheumatism, also called Poncet's disease. Poncet's disease is characterized by sterile polyarthritis during active tuberculosis infection. It is considered a reactive arthritis, which is a different entity from tuberculous arthritis. Although this is a rare disease, we should be aware of it in hemodialysis patient clinics, because the incidence of tuberculosis infection has been reported to be increasing in patients with end-stage renal failure."
351,14514418,2003-09-30,Proliferation characteristics and polyploidization of cultured myofibroblasts from a patient with fibroblastic rheumatism.,N/A,"Fibroblast-like cells were obtained from a nodule of a patient with fibroblastic rheumatism, and grown in culture for different times (from passage 3 to 21). These cells as well as the fibroblasts taken from an unaffected skin area (controls) of the same patient, have been investigated by fluorescence microscopy, cytochemical methods and cytometry, to evaluate their cytodifferentiation features and cytokinetic characteristics. In addition, in low-passage cultures, the secretion of collagen and of non-collagenic proteins was evaluated using electrophoretic techniques. The immunolabeling with antibodies against sm-specific a-actin (which was taken as a marker of myofibroblasts) showed that, already in low-passage cultures, the percentage of myofibroblasts was higher in the nodule-derived cell populations, and progressively increased with increasing passages. This suggests that myofibroblasts have higher proliferation potential than control fibroblasts. Myofibroblasts were also found to undergo polyploidization and hypertrophy, especially in high-passage cultures. Based on these results, it may be hypothesized that in fibroblastic rheumatism the development of the typical nodules could depend on the intrinsic capability of myofibroblats of proliferating faster than normal fibroblasts and of becoming polyploid and hypertrophic. Nodule-derived cells in culture synthesized slightly less collagen and non-collagen proteins than did the control fibroblasts; this suggests that the increased fibrosis observed in nodules in situ could be likely dependent on a reduced degradation of the extracellular matrix components."

With the aid of a grant from the Pfizer Foundation in 2002, ARi has been able to further develop into a strong organization throughout the world, with a membership of 22 countries. Successful intitiatives include the People with Arthritis and Rheumatism in Europe Manifesto, which has served as a very effective focus for developing action plans, opening dialogues, building partnerships with other organizations, lobbying governments, and gaining media attention throughout Europe. The manifesto (website: www.PAREmanifesto.org) was developed by ARi working in conjunction with The International Organisation of Youth with Rheumatism and the EULAR Social League.

We periodically conduct a survey of our membership for the Rheumatism White Paper, which we have been publishing since the JRFA was formed. The entire membership is surveyed every 5 years; surveys give an accurate picture of the current state of the disease and reflect the fundamental activities of the JRFA; they shed light on progress in developing effective measures against arthritis, and give people a better understanding of rheumatism. The survey is also a unique resource, for it canvasses a wide cross section of people with arthritis. In Japan, the Rheumatism White Paper is widely regarded as an authoritative source. The aims of the JRFA are to promote the accurate knowledge of RA to improve mutual friendship, and to work for the establishment and development of policies against RA disease. In this way, the JRFA seeks to advance the welfare of RA patients. In this article the activities of the JRFA are described."
354,12906020,2003-08-09,Etanercept: new preparation. Useful after methotrexate failure in inflammatory rheumatism.,N/A,"There is no reference second-line treatment for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile chronic arthritis, psoriatic arthropathy or ankylosing spondylitis after failure or intolerance of a slow-acting antirheumatic drug such as methotrexate. Etanercept, a immunosuppressant targeting TNF-alpha (like infliximab), is now approved in France for use in these situations, with the exception of spondylitis. In the second-line treatment of adults with rheumatoid arthritis, the clinical evaluation dossier on etanercept contains data from dose-finding studies and two placebo-controlled trials involving patients in whom several single-agent treatments had failed. At a dose of 25 mg subcutaneously twice a week, etanercept worked partially in about half the patients. Without direct comparisons, the place of etanercept relative to other slow-acting antirheumatic drugs is difficult to establish. From indirect comparisons, etanercept seems a slightly better treatment option than infliximab. In the first-line treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, one trial showed that etanercept worked faster than methotrexate, but there was no significant difference between the two treatments after two years. Little is known about the efficacy of etanercept in patients with juvenile chronic arthritis who do not respond adequately to methotrexate. There are no comparative trials. One double-blind placebo-controlled trial showed that etanercept, when it worked, remained active for at least 7 months. In one trial, etanercept was more effective than placebo in patients with psoriatic arthropathy and ankylosing spondylitis who continued to receive their usual treatment, which included a slow-acting antirheumatic drug in about 50% of cases. More than 50% of patients treated with etanercept have a cutaneous reaction to the injection. These reactions are usually mild or moderate. Active pharmacovigilance is needed, given its mechanism of action, and previous notifications of a wide variety of adverse effects (even though it is sometimes difficult to establish a foolproof link between etanercept and the adverse effect). Long-term studies of large numbers of patients are needed to determine the precise risk of side effects including haematological, infectious, neurological, oncological and immunological effects. In practice, methotrexate remains the first-line treatment for inflammatory arthritis. Etanercept can be a useful second-line treatment, especially in juvenile chronic arthritis."

Only six observations have been described. We report a case of rheumatismal hyperthyroidism successfully treated with carbimazole and propranolol.
A 52 year-old woman presented with inflammatory rheumatismal pain predominating at the waist for the past six months and resistant to synthetic anti-inflammatories. Thyroid hormone analysis permitted diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. Initiation of treatment with carbimazole led to the rapid regression of the rheumatismal manifestations.
Hyperthyroidism is classically manifested by signs of hypercatabolism. Osteoarticular manifestations are dominated by humeroscapular periarthrosis. Rheumatismal hyperthyroidism is characterised by inflammatory rheumatismal pain evoking, as in our patient, a rhizomelic pseudo-polyarthritis. The outcome, whatever the anti-thyroid treatment, is always good. The physiopathological mechanisms are unknown. They may be due to an attack of the antibodies against the synovial and/or cartilage structures, or to the effect of propranolol.
It is important to underline the interest of thyroid hormone assay in cases of dubious etiological inflammatory rheumatism and/or resistant to classical treatments."
357,12730510,2003-05-06,Prevalence and clinical significance of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide and antikeratin antibodies in palindromic rheumatism. An abortive form of rheumatoid arthritis?,N/A,"To analyse the prevalence and clinical significance of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (anti-CCP) and antikeratin antibodies (AKA) in patients with palindromic rheumatism (PR).
Sixty-three patients with PR were included: 33 were defined as pure or persistent PR at the time of serum test measurement, and 30 as associated PR, defined as patients with past history of PR who had developed persistent arthritis at the time of serum test: [21 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA)]. Sixty patients with early RA, and 80 with seronegative spondyloarthropathy were included as control groups. Anti-CCP were determined by a standardized ELISA test and AKA by indirect immunofluorescence in rat oesophagus. Clinical characteristics of these pure PR patients were compared according to the presence or absence of anti-CCP antibodies. A follow-up study was also performed.
Anti-CCP were detected in 18 out of 32 (56.3%) patients with pure PR and 10 out of 30 (33.3%) with associated PR (38.1% in RA-associated PR patients). AKA were detected in 12 patients out of 33, with pure PR (36.4%), and in 9 out of 30 with associated PR (30%) (33.3% in RA-associated PR patients). The prevalence of anti-CCP and AKA in the RA control group was 55% (not significantly different from the pure PR group) and 61.7% (with respect to pure PR patients, P=0.02), respectively. In the spondyloarthropathy group, the prevalence of anti-CCP and AKA was 2.5 and 3.8%, respectively (P<0.001 compared with pure PR patients). No significant clinical differences were observed between pure PR patients with and without CCP antibodies.
Anti-CCP and, to a lesser extent, AKA, were found in a high proportion of patients with PR, suggesting that this syndrome is an abortive form of RA. The predictive value of these antibodies in PR, as markers of progression to an established RA, remains uncertain."

The pathologic synovial tissue during articular inflammatory rheumatism is well known to have a damaging effect responsible of early cartilage injury, as well as symptomatic action (e.g. articular stiffness, effusion, pain, functional limitation). Therefore to value the removal of such a tissue you should think of the secondary prevention of cartilage injury, besides the symptomatic point of view. Since 1996 we performed 190 arthroscopic synovectomy, the adopted criteria of judgement were: pain (spontaneous, during active and passive movements), effusion or swelling presence, articular range and cartilage state (evaluated during arthroscopy according to Outerbridg's classification). 70% of the cases showed good results and six years later the beginning of this activity we retain arthroscopic synovectomy as a valid help in articular inflammatory rheumatism treatment."

Incidences of disability pensioning for three main musculoskeletal diseases - rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and soft tissue rheumatism - during the period 1968-97 were assessed. Changes in incidence were related to changes in Norwegian society with respect to prevalence of these diseases, the number of individuals having high probability of disability pensioning for these diseases, the labour market and legal amendments that may have changed the probability of being granted a disability pension among these patients.
Data on all new disability pensioners aged 50-66 years registered by the National Insurance Administration during 1968-97 and the total population of Norway excluding disability pensioners were used to calculate annual incidence rates of disability pension for the selected musculoskeletal diagnoses.
The incidence of disability pension for soft tissue rheumatism and osteoarthritis increased during the study period, and both increased more than the incidence of disability pension in general. The incidence of disability pension for rheumatoid arthritis decreased when compared with disability pensioning in general. The year an upward or downward trend started is similar for osteoarthritis and soft tissue rheumatism for men and women in the age groups studied.
Changes in prevalence of a disease seem to be an important factor in explaining differences in time trends of disability pensioning with different diagnoses. Changes in unemployment, female employment, number of manual workers or the legal system do not appear to be related to the increases in incidence of disability pensioning with musculoskeletal diseases."

In this chapter the most prevalent conditions, low back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain, arm/wrist/hand conditions and widespread pain, are discussed. A better term for referring to these health problems is regional and widespread pain disorders. The prevalence and the impact on health care and society of these conditions is high. Many physical, psychosocial and work-related factors play a role in aetiology and prognosis. A good prevention policy does not exist for most conditions due to the lack of knowledge on risk factors, risk groups and trends. To improve the epidemiological research on regional and widespread pain disorders, research should focus on clear and relevant definitions of cases or pain subgroups and on specific risk factors."

A questionnaire survey was conducted with 3407 qualified doctors of Japan Rheumatism Foundation (response rate 20%). Subjects were asked to assume three patient groups characterized by treatment status (outpatient, inpatient with inactive treatment and inpatient with active treatment) and to answer the questions about (1) percent distributions of the groups a decade ago and today and (2) QOL, including physical functions, daily living activities and social activities, of each group.
More than 70% of patients with RA and OA were included in the outpatient group, who had problems in social activities rather than in physical functions and daily living activities. During the last decade, percentage of he outpatient group was increased, while those of the inpatient groups were decreased, and QOL of patients with RA and OA was improved. Compared with OA, RA showed lower percentages of the inpatient groups and greater losses in physical functions, daily living activities and social activities. Accordingly, the burden of RA was greater than that of OA.

Multiple, skin- to pink-colored, firm papules were noted on the periungual areas, hands, feet, and nose. There was swelling of the proximal interphalangeal joints, wrists, elbows, ankles, and knees. A skin biopsy specimen revealed dermal fibrosis and interspersed histiocytes and lymphocytes. These findings were consistent with fibroblastic rheumatism, a condition characterized by cutaneous nodules and a symmetric polyarthritis. He was treated with methotrexate and corticosteroids with improvement in the symptoms of his arthritis and skin lesions. This early treatment was beneficial in our patient."
364,12415605,2002-11-05,Use of complementary and alternative therapies by patients self-reporting arthritis or rheumatism: results from a nationwide canadian survey.,N/A,"Arthritis or rheumatism (A/R) often leads patients to experiment with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM); we investigated the factors associated with use of CAM.
The source of the data is the cross sectional household component of the 1996-97 National Population Health Survey of the health status and behaviors of Canadians. The survey sample is based on 66,000 persons aged 20 years and older, representing 21 million adults. Cross tabulations were used to estimate the percentage of adults with A/R who used CAM. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify those characteristics associated with the use of CAM in the year preceding the survey.
In 1996-97, among the 3.3 million Canadian adults aged 20 years or older who self-reported arthritis, 22% utilized CAM in the past year. CAM users tended to be younger and with higher education and household income. They reported more pain, consumed more analgesics, and tended to be more depressed. The coexistence of back or bowel disorders, cancer, sinusitis, or food allergies with arthritis was also related to CAM use. Moreover, CAM users also used more traditional health resources.
Our results indicate that patients with A/R consulting CAM providers self-report more intense symptoms than nonusers and often have other chronic conditions. They do not seem to reject the traditional health care system, but supplement it with CAM, possibly to fulfill needs insufficiently satisfied by traditional health care providers."
365,12415587,2002-11-05,HLA and cytokine gene polymorphisms in relation to occurrence of palindromic rheumatism and its progression to rheumatoid arthritis.,N/A,"Palindromic rheumatism (PR) is an episodic arthropathy that may precede typical rheumatoid arthritis (RA), although pathogenetic relationships between these disorders remain unclear. The predictive value for those immunogenetic risk factors implicated in RA for disease progression in PR remains to be established. A previous retrospective analysis from our group has implicated rheumatoid factor in disease progression. Our objective was to determine the contribution of HLA and cytokine gene polymorphisms implicated in RA to predisposition to PR and to progression of PR to chronic joint inflammation.
We studied 147 patients with PR seen in a tertiary referral center; 87 were selected retrospectively from the period 1986-96 using a structured selection process and 60 were selected prospectively in the period 1997-2001. Comparison groups included 149 patients with RA and 149 ethnically matched controls. Typing for HLA-DRB1 alleles and HLA-DRB1-04 subtypes was performed following polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using sequence-specific primers (SSP). Cytokine genotypes were ascertained following PCR-SSP with and without digestion with restriction enzymes. Time-adjusted survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier) and multivariate logistic regression were used to assess the independent contribution of immunogenetic markers in assessing progression of PR to chronic joint inflammation.
Thirty-one percent of patients progressed to connective tissue disease after a mean of 10.6 (retrospective group) and 3.9 (prospective group) years. A significantly increased prevalence of the shared epitope (SE) allele was noted in patients with PR (65%) versus controls (39%) (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.8-4.6, p < 0.001). This primarily reflected increased prevalence of the DRB1-0401 and 0404 and not DRB1-01 alleles. A weak contribution to disease susceptibility was also noted with carriage of the IL4 promoter -590T (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1-3.0, p = 0.02) and IL4 intron 3 RP1 (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.9, p = 0.03) alleles. The TNFa +489A allele was associated with RA (OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.5-5.1, p = 0.001) in both SE+ and SE- patients, but not with PR. Time-adjusted and multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that only homozygosity for SE alleles was a significant independent risk factor for disease progression to chronicity in PR (hazard ratio 2.9, 95% CI 1.2-6.9, p = 0.02). However, none of 8 patients homozygous for SE- DRB1 XP4n alleles developed chronic disease after 10 years of followup (p = 0.07).
The immunogenetic risk profile for PR resembles that for RA, indicating that PR is likely not an independent entity. A significant gene dose effect for SE alleles is operative in determining risk for progression from PR to RA."

We report on a patient who presented a 4-year history of pink to skin-coloured nodular lesions symmetrically localized at para-articular sites without evident rheumatological symptoms. Histopathology of a skin nodule led to the diagnosis of fibroblastic rheumatism showing a poorly circumscribed dermal proliferation of spindle and stellate fibroblast-like cells embedded in thickened collagen bundles with a marked reduction of elastic fibres. X-rays of both hands and feet showed metacarpophalangeal, metatarsalphalangeal and interphalangeal erosions, unexpected by patient history. This case of fibroblastic rheumatism appears unique in view of the absence of any clinical manifestation of polyarthritis at 7 years from appearance of skin lesions."

Two patients, a 35-year-old man and a 44-year-old man, had been suffering from episodic attacks and remission of oligoarthralgia for 15 years and 6 years, respectively. Both patients were negative for rheumatoid factors, and exhibited slightly elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate at the times of the attacks. Radiograms of the affected joints showed no erosion of the bones in either patient. Ultrasonographic examination revealed both synovial effusion and synovial proliferation in the 35-year-old patient, suggesting conversion from palindromic rheumatism to rheumatoid arthritis, whereas only synovial effusion was found in the 44-year-old patient, suggesting the persistence of palindromic rheumatism. Ultrasonographic evaluations of synovial proliferation in the knee joints provide data that can be used to identify the period of conversion from palindromic rheumatism to the early-stage of rheumatoid arthritis."

Being a parent is probably also physically demanding. Having manual work and being a parent will be analyzed as possible predictors of becoming a disability pensioner with soft tissue rheumatism (DPSTR) after controlling for level of education, employment, number of hours worked, income, age, sex, and marital status.
In this prospective study based on census data of persons 30-39 years old in 1980, predictors of becoming DPSTR during the followup period 1981-90 were identified by logistic regression analysis.
Manual work was a predictor for becoming DPSTR for both men and women, while being a parent was neither a risk factor nor a protective factor for becoming DPSTR. Being employed was a predictor of becoming DPSTR for married women, but a protective factor for unmarried women and all men. Low level of education and being married or divorced were predictors of becoming DPSTR for both men and women. Working part time and having low income were predictors of becoming DPSTR among men.
Physically demanding employment, but not a physically demanding private life, predicts becoming DPSTR. This may reflect that factors concerning a patient's private life are not taken into account when evaluating whether or not a disability pension should be granted, at least not for patients with uncertain medical conditions."

(2) To determine the screening characteristics of the Arabic version of the CCQ for detecting rheumatic diseases compared to clinical examination by a rheumatologist.
Translation and assessment of cross cultural equivalence were undertaken using standard methods. Back translation was done by an Arabic-speaking rheumatologist. Interviewer agreement was assessed using a convenience sample. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were assessed first by administering the CCQ followed by full clinical examinations of a randomly selected sample of 359 Kuwaiti persons aged 15 years or older.
(1) Cross cultural equivalence and back translation of the translated questionnaire were satisfactory. Interviewer agreement was acceptable. (2) The prevalence of rheumatic diseases based only on CCQ screening was 69% compared to 73% based on clinical examination. The sensitivity and specificity of the Arabic CCQ were 94.4% and 97%, respectively, and the positive and negative predictive values of the instrument were 98.8% and 86.4%, respectively.
The Arabic version of the CCQ appears promising as a screening tool to detect rheumatic diseases in Arabic speaking communities. The findings suggest that the Arabic CCQ followed by clinical examinations in positive respondents can provide an acceptable estimate of prevalence of rheumatic diseases. We intend to use this instrument to screen for the prevalence of rheumatic diseases among Kuwaiti nationals."

All the patients underwent examination of the cardiovascular system, standard laboratory tests and tests for antistreptolysine-0, antistreptokinase, antistreptohyaluronidase, streptococcal antigen, microbiological tests. The diagnosis of rheumatic fever was established on the basis of Kisel-Jones-Nesterov and revised Jones criteria.
The adaptation cryoglobulinemia syndrome in healthy persons was associated with cardialgia, arthralgia, lumbalgia, myalgia, lymphadenopathy and Raynaud's phenomenon. Patients with rheumatic fever and adaptation cryoglobulinemia syndrome were predisposed to chronicity of primary rheumatic carditis, development of compound and combined valvular defects, arrhythmia and hemodynamic disturbances.
The presence of the adaptation cryoglobulinemia syndrome aggravates the course of rheumatic fever and promotes its chronicity."

379,11778312,2002-01-10,[Initial studies of the application of the linear signal transfer theory in evaluating diaphanoscopic examinations exemplified by rheumatism diagnosis].,N/A,"Rheumatoid arthritis affecting the small joints--in particular the fingers--has advantageous geometry for the transmission of near-infrared (NIR) light. Examination of the optical properties of tissues has revealed that as a result of changes to the capsule and synovial fluid there is a considerable increase in photon scattering already in the early stages of the disease--in particular around 685 nm. This suggests the appropriateness of analysing the photon density profile resulting from punctiform irradiation of the joint. In a first approximation, the point spread function of transmitted photon density is confirmed to be proportional to a Gauss distribution, as suggested by Arridge. In accordance with the linear signal transfer theory, therefore, it is possible to establish a virtual transfer system described by a first-order differential equation. (The tissue optical conditions mu a << mu's and mu a = constant (mu a = absorption coefficient) were assumed). The parameter mu's (= reduced scattering coefficient) was determined by linear approximation of the Gauss distribution to the calculated or measured point spread function. For selected patient data, the mu's was determined in healthy and diseased finger joints (e.g. 10.1 cm-1 and 26.8 cm-1, respectively), and the results were in good agreement with those obtained experimentally."

International League of Associations for Rheumatology. European League Against Rheumatism.,N/A,"New classification criteria (ILAR) have been proposed for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). They are more descriptive than those formerly used [American College of Rheumatology (ACR), European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)], but require validation against classifications already in use. We validated the ILAR criteria in relation to the EULAR criteria in a prospective, incidence, and population based setting, and analyzed their feasibility.
Construct validity of ILAR and EULAR classification criteria refers to how closely the 2 instruments are related and how each of them operates in classifying subgroups/categories. Twenty doctors in 5 Nordic countries collected data from the incidence cases within their catchment areas during an 18 month period beginning July 1, 1997. Clinical and serological data from the first year of disease were collected.
A total of 322 patients were included. Classification according to the ILAR criteria was possible in 321 patients; 290 patients had a disease duration > or = 3 months and were classified according to the EULAR criteria. One child could only be classified according to the EULAR criteria. Thus, 31/322 (9.6%) children were classified according to the ILAR criteria only. Forty-eight of 321 (15%) patients did not fit into any category and 6% (20/321) fulfilled criteria for2 categories. In the ILAR classification 5 out of 7 categories/subgroups have 2 to 5 specified exclusion criteria that highly discriminate the definition of each patient. In our study the exclusion criteria were fulfilled to only a small extent.
The EULAR and ILAR criteria differ concerning the operational definitions of the subvariables involved, which complicates their comparison. By using ILAR rather than EULAR criteria the number of cases with juvenile arthritis increased by 10%, considering the first half-year after onset. The validity of the ILAR criteria is low since they often exclude patients from subgroup classification and the possibility of having more than one diagnosis is not negligible. The specified exclusion criteria for some of the subgroups are difficult to fulfill in clinical work and variables involved could be questioned with regard to their consistency."

In April 1997, she suffered from arthralgia and stiffness of both wrists, and then of the big toes. X-rays showed destructive and erosive lesions on both wrists and on the PIP of the second and third fingers and the big toes. Laboratory investigations disclosed normal values for ESR and CRP and negative results for ANA and RF. The diagnosis of fibroblastic rheumatism was based on the typical histologic pattern of a nodule. The treatment associated colchicin and rehabilitation. In August 1998, the wrists' stiffness began to improve, though the big toes remained totally stiff. The radiologic erosive lesions did not show progress.
The diagnosis of fibroblastic rheumatism is based on the histologic pattern of the nodules. The erosive evolution of the arthropathies is infrequent (8/15 cases in adults).

Available health statistics were used to quantify the burden of illness due to musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions. Next, a bibliographic analysis of MEDLINE was performed comparing disease categories using the MeSH tree structure for 1991 and 1996. Diseases were ranked according to the frequency of citations attributable to them and further analyses were performed for journal categories, MeSH subheadings, and the frequency of citations for specific types of arthritis and rheumatic diseases.
Compared with 9 other causes, MSK diseases are leading contributors to health professional consultations, total health costs, chronic ill health, and disability. In contrast, MSK diseases ranked ninth among twelve major MEDLINE disease categories in 1996 and 1991. These rankings were similarly low across journal categories reflecting basic science research and clinical application. Radiography, rehabilitation, history and embryology were the most frequently used subheadings for MSK diseases. In 1996, there were 16,603 citations for MSK diseases, led by bone diseases (7,304 citations), joint diseases (4,987), muscular diseases (4,236), arthritis (3,555), and rheumatic diseases (3195). Among arthritic and rheumatic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis had the largest number of citations (2,004), followed by systemic lupus erythematosus (927) and osteoarthritis (793).

Gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity owing to the use of NSAIDs is a well-recognized clinical problem, with approximately 25% of all reported adverse drug reactions being attributed to prescription NSAID use. In addition to prescription NSAIDs, the use of over-the-counter (OTC) formulations of these products is common. Although it has been suggested that OTC doses of NSAIDs may not lead to significant GI toxicity, the data confirming this have been lacking. Data on the GI risks of OTC doses of aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, paracetamol, and no drug from 4164 consecutively diagnosed patients with rheumatoid arthritis from eight ARAMIS (Arthritis, Rheumatism, and Aging Medical Information System) centers in North America are presented. Serious GI events were defined as GI bleeds and other clinically significant GI events requiring hospitalization. Relative risks were standardized for potential demographic confounders using Cox proportional hazard models. Although the relative risk of OTC doses of NSAIDs (3 to 4) is less than the previously published risk of prescription doses (6 to 7), it remains clinically significant and a matter of serious concern because of the widespread use of these medications and an underappreciation of the true risk. Paracetamol was not associated with increased risk of GI complications and should be considered first-line therapy."

The first record was about 3,500 years ago in the Ebers papyrus. Hippocrates, Celsus, Pliny the Elder, Dioscorides and Galen all recommended decoctions containing salicylate for rheumatic pain. A country parson, the Reverend Edward Stone of Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, made the first ""clinical trial"" of willow bark (1). He was surprised by its bitter taste, which reminded him of cinchona bark (containing quinine), then being used to treat malaria. He harvested a pound of willow bark, dried it, pulverized it and dispersed it in tea, small beer or water. He found in 50 patients that doses of 1 dram (1.8g) cured their fever. He concluded ""I have no other motives for publishing this valuable specific, than that it may have a fair and full trial in all its variety of circumstances and situations, and that the world may reap the benefits accruing from it"". Salicylic acid was chemically synthesised in 1860 by Kolbe in Germany and its ready supply led to even more extended usage as an external antiseptic, as an antipyretic and in the treatment of rheumatism."
392,10921257,2000-08-02,[The diagnostic significance of the indices of oxygen-dependent neutrophil metabolism in rheumatism patients with a background of leukopenia].,N/A,"Results are submitted of investigations designed to study parameters characterizing the peripheral blood neutrophil functional activity in leukopenias accompanying the course of rheumatism. Neutrophils were proved to be defective, their disturbed functional activity being manifested by the decrement of their ability to restore the NBT-test. There has been noted an inadequate augmentation of the metabolic activity following neutrophil stimulation as compared to results in healthy subjects. Of practical significance in the above investigations is screening of patients presenting with low values for the functional reserve of neutrophils as a threat to the early prediction of the course of pyo-inflammatory complications. It is suggested that a spontaneous NBT-test be used in the differential diagnosis of bacterial and non-bacterial complications while a stimulated NBT-test is believed to be helpful in identifying neutrophil dysfunction when results of a spontaneous NBT-test are at variance with clinical findings."

394,10895376,2000-07-15,Palindromic rheumatism: effect of dietary manipulation.,N/A,"Evaluation of the contribution of dietary components in triggering the attacks of palindromic rheumatism (PR), and the effect of dietary manipulation on the frequency and severity of PR attacks.
Sixteen patients (10 males, 6 females) were diagnosed as having PR during 1994-8 in one center. Their mean age was 45 +/- 6, duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis was 4 +/- 1.4 years, and frequency of PR attacks were 3.1 +/- 1.8/month. All patients were instructed to make a list of the food that was consumed daily and to specify the dates of PR episodes. Data were evaluated after a period of 2-4 months in each patient.
In 5 patients (31%) there was an association between episodes of PR and certain foods that were consumed within 36 hours prior to PR episodes. These were fish (2 patients), eggs, canned vegetables and processed cheese (each in one case). Elimination of the relevant food from each patient's diet resulted in complete cessation of the PR attacks in two of the cases, while the other three had milder, infrequent attacks. Four patients were rechallenged with the offending food. In all cases it resulted in recurrence of the PR attacks. No association between PR episodes and prior consumption of certain foods could be documented in the other 11 patients.
In some PR patients ingestion of certain foods, specific for each case, can trigger the typical attack. It is suggested that this association should be looked for in any PR patient, as elimination of the offending food from the diet may help in preventing the PR attacks."

396,10648016,2000-01-27,Decreased progression to rheumatoid arthritis or other connective tissue diseases in patients with palindromic rheumatism treated with antimalarials.,N/A,"To determine whether the use of antimalarials is associated with a reduction in the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other connective tissue diseases in patients with palindromic rheumatism.
We conducted a retrospective cohort study based on a review of medical records to evaluate the outcome of patients with palindromic rheumatism referred to an academic center from 1986 to 1996: 113 patients complied with the selection criteria, including diagnostic criteria for palindromic rheumatism and onset of disease since 1980. After adjusting for potential confounders, Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression models were used to estimate the risk of developing RA or other connective tissue disease in patients who had received antimalarials compared to those who had not.
Age of disease onset was 40+/-12 yrs, and mean disease duration 4.8+/-4 yrs; two-thirds of the patients were female. Sixty-two (55%) patients received antimalarials, for a mean duration of therapy of 28 mo. Thirty-three (29%) patients developed RA, 3 developed systemic lupus, and 4 developed other connective tissue diseases. Twenty (32%) patients in the antimalarial group developed a secondary disease, compared to 20 (39%) who did not receive therapy. Statistically significant differences were observed comparing time to event in both groups. The estimated median time to development of a chronic disease was 162 months in treated and 56 months in untreated patients. After adjusting for other variables in the Cox regression models, significant risk reduction in the development of a secondary disease was observed for antimalarial use (hazard ratio = 0.24; 95% CI 0.09-0.61). For RA, the risk reduction was 0.19 (95% CI 0.07-0.57). We conducted a sensitivity analysis around our censoring estimates. The risk reduction remained statistically significant, with 0.36 for RA and 0.41 for RA or other connective tissue disease.
Use of antimalarials in patients with palindromic rheumatism is associated with a reduction in the risk of developing subsequent RA or other connective tissue disease."
397,10555900,1999-11-11,"HLA and self-limiting, unclassified rheumatism. A role for HLA-B35?",N/A,"To test the hypothesis of increased frequency of HLA-B35 in self-limiting, unclassified rheumatism (SUR).
Patients (n = 50) were included if they had swelling of one or more joints for more than 24 h and/or pain without trauma of 2 or more joints for one month or longer, and at least one of (1) history of joint swelling, (2) morning stiffness, (3) elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and/or C-reactive protein. Patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria sets of any rheumatic disease and patients with other identified diseases were excluded. Controls were 50 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 199 healthy blood donors.
HLA-B35 frequency (0.32) was significantly greater in SUR than in RA (0.14) and controls (0.17). HLA-DR4 frequency was significantly increased in HLA-B35 positive SUR, while that of HLA-DR1 was decreased (NS). Clinical characteristics of SUR were: history of atopy; transient, mono or oligoarticular synovitis and widespread, longlasting pain. HLA-B35 positive patients with SUR more often had hip, knee, or back pain than HLA-B35 negative patients.
HLA-B35 frequency is increased in SUR, while HLA-DR1 frequency is not. A likely hypothesis of attenuated immune inflammation in SUR is further supported by results in juvenile RA, adult Still's disease, and a series of mild inflammatory arthritides, and by indirect evidence of decreased Th1 response and increased Th2 response in HLA-B35 positive patients with various conditions."

They were treated with autologous peripheral blood or bone marrow transplants according to predetermined criteria. Two patients died after mobilisation before transplant. Seventy-two patients were given 73 transplants, seven bone marrow, and 66 mobilised peripheral blood stem cell transplants. The graft was manipulated to remove T and/or B cells in 43 cases. All 73 transplants engrafted. Five patients died of transplant-related complications: two from bleeding, three from infections. Two patients died of progressive disease. The transplant-related mortality at 1 year of 9% (1-17%; 95% CI) is comparable to the transplant-related mortality of 6% (3-9%; 95% CI) in patients transplanted during the same period in Europe for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in sensitive relapse (P = 0.39). Sixty patients are evaluable for response, 40 patients (65%) showed some improvement in their disease. Haematopoietic stem cell transplants are feasible for patients with severe refractory autoimmune disease. Transplant-related mortality is comparable to results in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in responsive relapse. Two-thirds of the patients show at least some response. These preliminary data are promising. Although associated with considerable risk, randomised trials comparing autologous stem cell transplants to conventional therapy are warranted."

400,10090159,1999-03-25,Prognostic factors for the development of rheumatoid arthritis and other connective tissue diseases in patients with palindromic rheumatism.,N/A,"Palindromic rheumatism is characterized by attacks of acute arthritis of short duration. In the long term, a substantial proportion of patients will develop rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other connective tissue diseases, but the determinants of subsequent chronic disease have not been adequately established. We identify clinical prognostic factors for the development of RA and other connective tissue diseases in patients with palindromic rheumatism in a retrospective cohort study.
The medical records of 4900 patients with arthritis referred from 1986 to 1996 to 3 rheumatologists at an academic center were reviewed. One hundred sixty patients were diagnosed as having palindromic rheumatism. After review, 127 complied with diagnostic criteria for palindromic rheumatism. Disease duration was estimated as time of first attack until the last consultation, or the development of RA or other connective tissue disease. Survival analysis including Cox regression was used to identify clinical variables associated with the risk of developing RA or other connective tissue disease, adjusting for varying disease duration.
Sixty-five percent of the patients were female. Age at onset was 40+/-12 years. Mean disease duration was 6+/-6 years, and mean followup by the rheumatologists was 40+/-45 months. Joints more frequently affected were wrist, knee, and metacarpophalangeal. Forty-three patients (34%) subsequently developed a connective tissue disease including 36 (28%) RA, 3 (2%) systemic lupus erythematosus, and 4 (3%) other connective tissue diseases. In the final Cox regression model the hazard ratio for development of a connective tissue disease in the presence of a positive rheumatoid factor (RF) was 2.9 (p = 0.002), for proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint involvement 2.4 (p = 0.02), for wrist involvement 2.5 (p = 0.05), for female sex 2.2 (p = 0.05), and for age at onset 1.03 (per year) (p = 0.001). Female patients with positive RF and involvement of the hands had an 8-fold risk of developing disease, compared with patients with one or fewer of these features.
Positive RF and early involvement of the wrist and PIP joints predict the subsequent development of RA or other connective tissue disease in patients with palindromic rheumatism, and identify a group of patients at increased risk."

Among the patients who visited the Rheumatology Division, Keimyung University Dongsan Medical Center, Taegu, Korea from March 1997 to February 1998, 35 patients, with more than 3 months follow-up, were compatible for the diagnosis of Behcet disease according to the Shimizu criteria, after exclusion of uncertain or possible Behcet cases. The presence of various manifestations was evaluated. Regarding the joint manifestations, the involved joint, signs and the pattern of the articular symptoms were examined. Basic laboratory tests, HLA studies and simple radiologic studies were done.
All 35 patients had evident, recurrent, painful oral ulcers by the study definition. Genital ulcers were found in 29%, skin lesions in 77%, uveitis in 9%, gastrointestinal ulcerations in 6% and vascular manifestations in 6%. Joint manifestations appeared in 97%. Knee(91%), proximal interphalangeal (53%) and metacarpophalangeal joints(21%) were the main sites. Tenderness was prominent in 91% and swelling in 44%. Polyarticular presentation was found in 47%. In most cases (76.4%), the articular symptom was short-lasting. C-reactive protein was likely to be positive in active Behcet disease. HLA B51 was positive in 46%.
In Behcet disease, various manifestations can be found. The arthritic manifestation seems quite common. It may present as seronegative rheumatoid arthritis. Otherwise, it may present as palindromic rheumatism."
402,9922998,1999-01-29,[Acute articular rheumatism in the child in 1997].,N/A,"Nine cases of rheumatic fever were seen from 1982 to 1996. The diagnosis was based on Jones criteria. Four of eight children had carditis characterized by mitral regurgitation with or without aortic regurgitation and/or atrioventricular conduction disturbances. The outcome was favorable in all the patients who had carditis initially; one of the patients without initial carditis developed permanent cardiac lesions during a recurrence with carditis. In industrialized countries, the incidence of rheumatic fever declined starting early in the XXth century, then dropped sharply after World War II, and is now extraordinarily low (mean annual incidence, 0.5/100,000 schoolage children). In developing countries, by contrast, rheumatic fever was recognized only after World War II and remains endemic (mean annual incidence, 100 to 200/100,000 schoolage children), contributing a substantial proportion of cases of cardiovascular disease. The diagnosis is difficult and rests on clinical grounds since there is no specific laboratory test. Diagnostic delays are potentially serious. Acute attacks should be managed as therapeutic emergencies. Prevention of recurrences rests on long-term antimicrobial therapy. Rheumatic fever is a disease process resulting from an inappropriate immune response to pharyngitis due to a beta-hemolytic group A streptotoccus (BHAS). A low standard of living may be a factor in developing countries but fails to explain the epidemic flares seen in these areas or the residual background incidence in industrialized countries. A role of host-related susceptibility to the disease has not been demonstrated. The type-specific surface M protein, the main factor associated with high virulence, carries a specific epitope on its distal portion. Rheumatogenic strains have been identified; most produce mucoid colonies. At a given point in time, within a given serotype, the virulence of a specific strain increases. Temporal and spatial variations of observed types contribute additional complexity. Adhesion of the organisms is followed by release of streptococcal degradation products that share antigenic determinants with human tissues including the heart, the synovium, and the neurons. The hyaluronate capsule and M protein of the organisms are capable of initiating immune responses; their presentation to CD4+ T-cells results in lymphokine production, an acute phase humoral response, and a cell-mediated response potentially responsible for permanent valvular damage. In France, the standard of care is to prescribe antimicrobial therapy to all patients with pharyngitis or tonsillitis without performing tests to identify the causative agent. The introduction of tests for the rapid recognition in routine clinical practice of BHAS, which account for only 20 to 30% of all cases of pharyngitis and tonsillitis, should allow a more rational approach to the treatment of these infections. Reserving antimicrobial therapy to those patients with BHAS should not result in an increase in the incidence or rheumatic fever."

Their ability to determine which patients presenting with early synovitis have ""true"" RA is not known. We evaluated whether the 1987 ARA classification criteria for RA in patients newly presenting with inflammatory polyarthritis (IP) predict persistent, disabling, or erosive arthritis.
We studied 486 patients with early IP referred to the Norfolk Arthritis Register. The 1987 ARA criteria were applied at baseline, and assessed for their ability to identify (1) patients referred to hospital for whom the diagnosis of RA was recorded by the hospital physician; (2) patients at 3 years with (a) persistent synovitis; (b) moderate or greater disability; and (c) erosions.
At baseline, 323 (67%) patients satisfied the ARA criteria in the classification tree format. Exactly 50% of those referred to hospital were given a diagnosis of RA. By 3 years, 76% of the 486 patients had persistent disease, 36% had a Health Assessment Questionnaire score > or = 1, and 40% had erosions. The sensitivity of the criteria was good, ranging from 77 to 87% depending on the outcome. The specificities were poor, and thus the overall discriminatory ability showed little improvement over random probability.
. Among patients newly presenting with IP, the 1987 ARA criteria for RA had a low ability to discriminate between patients who developed persistent, disabling, or erosive disease and those who did not. Alternative criteria are required for studies investigating early RA."

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of prednisolone 7.5 mg daily in addition to routine medication over 2 yr in 128 patients with early rheumatoid arthritis, using radiological progression (changes in the Larsen score) and the development of erosions as primary outcome measures. Study medication was blindly discontinued and follow-up maintained for a further year. Other assessments included disability, joint inflammation, pain and the acute-phase response.
Similar results were obtained when all available radiographs were included for each year of assessment (maximum 114) and when only patients with radiographs at all time points were included (75 patients). In these 75, the mean progression in the prednisolone group was 0.21 Larsen units in year 1, 0.04 units in year 2 and 1.01 units in year 3 (P = 0.587, 0.913 and 0.039 for change within each year, respectively).

There was little evidence for a flare in clinical symptoms after discontinuation of prednisolone.
Joint destruction resumed after discontinuation of prednisolone. This corroborates the previously reported therapeutic effect and challenges current concepts of disease pathogenesis."

The estimated prevalence of generalized hypermobility in the adult population is 5-15%. There have previously been suggestions that hypermobile individuals may be predisposed to soft-tissue trauma and subsequent musculoskeletal pain. This study was designed to examine the mobility status and physical activity level in consecutive rheumatology clinic attendees with a primary diagnosis of STR. Of 82 patients up to age 70 yr with STR, 29 (35%) met criteria for generalized hypermobility. Hypermobile compared to non-hypermobile individuals reported significantly more previous episodes of STR (90% vs 51%, P < 0.01), and more recurrent episodes of STR at a single site (69% vs 38%, P < 0.001). Although we were unable to show any difference in the time spent carrying out physical activity between the two groups, the hypermobile patients were performing significantly more repetitive activities. When specific anatomical sites of STR were analysed, small joints (elbows, hands and feet) currently affected with STR were more likely to show localized hypermobility than if those joints were asymptomatic. These findings suggest that hypermobility may be a factor in the development of STR. Repetitive activity may be a contributing factor towards STR in some hypermobile individuals."

NSP was confirmed by CT scan of the nasal fossae and sinuses. Polyps were surgically removed in four patients and the histology showed neither granuloma nor vasculitis. In four patients the joint symptoms, which responded poorly to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), improved markedly after ENT treatment (surgery and topical steroids) and synthetic antimalarials. The concomitant course of the joint and ENT symptoms suggests there may be a link between inflammatory rheumatism and NSP."

This is the first report of the sparing effect of hemiparesis on palindromic rheumatism."
419,9217556,1997-01-27,Soft-tissue rheumatism: diagnosis and treatment.,N/A,"Soft tissue rheumatism is one of the most common and most misunderstood categories of disorders facing the primary care physician. Among the more common types are subacromial bursitis, epicondylitis, trochanteric bursitis, anserine bursitis, and fibromyalgia. The keys to the diagnosis of soft-tissue rheumatism are the history and, more importantly, the physical examination. Extensive laboratory testing and radiographs are not as helpful in evaluating patients with these complaints. Treatment consists of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and nonnarcotic analgesics. Especially in patients with localized disorders, intralesional injections of corticosteroids are particularly effective and safe and should be part of the armamentarium of the primary care practitioner. Fibromyalgia is a particularly challenging form of nonarticular rheumatism. The clinical presentation is rather characteristic, with the patient typically being a woman 30-60 years of age who presents with diffuse somatic pain. Patients often give a history of sleep disturbance, may be depressed, and show characteristic tender areas, or trigger points. Laboratory findings are normal. Management includes reassurance, correction of the underlying sleep disturbance with low doses of a tricyclic antidepressant, treatment with muscle relaxants and nonnarcotic analgesics or NSAIDs, and an exercise program with a strong aerobic component."

423,9132322,1997-01-01,Efficacy and tolerability of a topical NSAID patch (local action transcutaneous flurbiprofen) and oral diclofenac in the treatment of soft-tissue rheumatism.,N/A,"The efficacy and safety of local action transcutaneous flurbiprofen 40 mg [flurbiprofen LAT] patches and diclofenac sodium tablets, 50 mg b.d., were compared in an open, multicentre, randomized, parallel-group study in patients with soft-tissue rheumatism. Patches were replaced at 12-hourly intervals. Clinical assessments were performed after 7 and 14 days of treatment. Fifty-six patients were treated with flurbiprofen LAT and 53 with diclofenac. Six withdrawals (three from each group) occurred during the treatment period. A statistically significant difference was observed in favour of flurbiprofen LAT for the principal measure, namely the investigator's opinion of overall change in clinical condition: 49/53 (92%) patients treated with flurbiprofen LAT had improved by day 14 compared with 36/49 (73%) patients receiving diclofenac sodium (p = 0.03; eligible dataset). There were also statistically significant differences in favour of flurbiprofen LAT for the investigator's assessments of the overall severity of the clinical condition (p = 0.03; eligible dataset), for the severity of pain at the region treated (p = 0.04; intent-to-treat), and for the severity of tenderness (p < 0.001; intent-to-treat). Supplementary analgesia (paracetamol) was required by two patients in the flurbiprofen LAT group and by eight diclofenac-treated patients. The difference in favour of flurbiprofen LAT in the average daily consumption of paracetamol was significant (p = 0.04). The patients' assessment of severity of pain on movement also favoured flurbiprofen LAT (p = 0.049; eligible dataset), but there were no statistically significant differences in day or night pain or quality of sleep. For the patients' opinion of treatment there was, however, a statistically significant difference in favour of flurbiprofen LAT (p = 0.02). Of the patients receiving flurbiprofen LAT, 94% regarded it as a convenient form of treatment. With respect to tolerability 8/56 (14%) patients applying flurbiprofen patches reported a total of nine adverse effects (AEs) (mainly local, mild skin irritations), vs 9/52 (17%) patients receiving diclofenac, who reported 12 AEs. Most AEs in the enteric-coated diclofenac group were of a gastrointestinal nature (one of which was severe). In terms of the proportion of patients reporting AEs related to the digestive system, there was a statistically significant difference in favour of flurbiprofen LAT (p = 0.011). In conclusion, local treatment of soft-tissue rheumatism with flurbiprofen LAT was demonstrably superior to benchmark oral therapy with diclofenac sodium over a 2-week period in terms of both efficacy and gastrointestinal tolerability. Flurbiprofen LAT provided both an effective and convenient form of topical SAID treatment."

The diagnosis is usually based on histologic examination of a skin nodule or synovium specimen. In the 11 previously reported cases, corticosteroid treatment, which has been widely used, was shown to have an unpredictable effect on the evolution of FR. We report a case of FR that was treated with methotrexate for 5 years, which led to complete recovery. This drug may be considered an effective treatment for FR. Further cases are needed to confirm this preliminary experience."
426,8948296,1996-11-01,Remission in a prospective study of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. American Rheumatism Association preliminary remission criteria in relation to the disease activity score.,N/A,"In a prospective follow-up study of patients with early-onset rheumatoid arthritis, the prevalence of remission according to the 1981 American Rheumatism Association (ARA) preliminary criteria was evaluated. A total of 227 patients with a median follow-up of 3.9 yr and a total of 2832 follow-up visits were studied. The ARA remission criteria were fulfilled in 9.5% of these visits. The percentage of patients with at least one visit fulfilling the ARA criteria was for years 2-6 approximately 25%. Each year, approximately 15% of the patients were in remission for at least two consecutive visits. A comparison was made between the ARA remission criteria and the Disease Activity Score (DAS). DAS < 1.6 corresponded with being in remission according to the ARA criteria. The DAS is being proposed as a tool to define remission because absence of disease activity should be measured using the same method as for higher levels of disease activity, preferably on a continuous scale."
427,8771752,1996-05-01,[The characteristics of the immune response to the polysaccharide determinants of Streptococcus group A in rheumatism].,N/A,"As shown in this study, the formation of antibodies, at least, to the determinants (DT) of polysaccharide of group A streptococcus (A-PS), common with epidermal antigens, occurs in rheumatic fever. Two DT include N-acetylglucosamine; DT common with epidermal basal cell antigen (DT-1) and DT common with antigen of the perinuclear zone of the cytoplasm of cells of differentiated layers (DT-2). Two other DT seem to contain only rhamnose; DT common with the cytoplasm of cells of differentiated layers (DT-3) and DT common with epidermal antigen, characteristic of the cytoplasm of cells of all epidermal layers (DT-4). Conclusion has been made that the presence of autoantibodies to epidermal basal cell antigens, common with DT-1 and DT-4 of A-PS, may serve as an additional indicator of the activity of the rheumatic process. Autoantibodies to cross-reacting DT-4 of A-PS are indicative of the chronization of the process with a tendency to relapses of rheumatic fever."

The 1958 and 1987 criteria were highly correlated (r = 0.795). By the 1958 criteria, 48 cases (92.3%) had classical/definite RA while 40 cases (76.9%) satisfied the 1987 criteria traditional format. By the 1987 classification tree 50 cases (96.2%) belonged to the first three RA subsets while 2 cases (3.8%) belonged to the non-RA subsets. Comparing the clinicians opinion of the outcome with the statistical modelling of variables based on ARA criteria, we conclude that the clinicians opinion of the outcome is reflected by a combination of morning stiffness duration, number of swollen joints, erosion score on hand radiographs and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. We conclude that evaluation of ARA 1958 and 1987 criteria in individual cases has both diagnostic and prognostic significance. We propose a short questionnaire based on ARA criteria, for use in hospital out patient clinic for diagnosis of RA."

In 52 of the 119 patients definite or possible pathological findings (in 18 cases bilateral) were observed. The relative frequency of sonographic findings in 223 evaluable hips was 33% and was somewhat higher in patients with rheumatoid arthritis than in those with other diagnoses. Changes were found significantly more often when the patient had joint complaints, limitation of movement, pathological X-ray changes or serological signs of inflammation (elevated ESR, positive C-reactive protein). The relative frequencies were higher than were expected on the basis of data in the literature. Of the pathological sonographic findings, 22% occurred in clinically and radiologically asymptomatic patients.
In view of the therapeutic consequences and the importance of early treatment, routine sonographic examination of the hip joint is recommended."

The interpopulation gene differentiation expressed through the generalized genetic distance (8) and the prevalence of rheumatism correlated (r = 0.63). There was also a correlation between the mean heterozygocity of the populations and the spread of rheumatism-the determination rate was 72%. Therefore, structural features of the populations have a definite impact on the prevalence of rheumatism and suggest that there is a genetic component in the determination of the disease. A segregative analysis indicated the adequacy of a multifactorial model for the majority of the studied populations, the contribution of a genetic component to the determination of varying susceptibility to rheumatism ranged from 71% in the population of the Tofalars to 100% in the populations of the Dolgans and the Tuvins. The results of testing the type of rheumatism inheritance using a SAL-2 model, the data of a regression analysis of susceptibility heritability and inbreedity of the populations, and a component resolution of phenotypic dispersion of susceptibility are indicative of its involvement, along with an additive component, in the determination of rheumatism. Clinical and genetic findings also suggest that there is a genetic heterogeneity both of rheumatism as a whole (verified +likely) and verified rheumatism (without and with cardiac diseases)."

Among Russia's children, the spread of rheumatism was 0.8 per 1,000 children, the diagnosis of active rheumatism and chronic heart rheumatic diseases being made in 10,068 (31%) and 16,405 (0.5%) children. That of active rheumatism was first established in 12071 persons. Therefore, in 1994 primary incidence of acute rheumatic fever was 0.08 per 1,000 inhabitants of all ages and 0.18 per 1,000 children. The incidence rates of acute rheumatism among children and adolescents annually increased by 62%. This rise was solely due to the North-Caucasian region of the Russian Federation where the pediatric morbidity was 0.92%. The statistical findings are regarded as an alarming signal for the likelihood of acute rheumatic fever in the Russian Federation."

437,19078012,1995-12-01,What to say to the patient who has just been diagnosed as having generalized rheumatism (fibromyalgia).,N/A,"By the time a patient with generalized rheumatism (fibromyalgia) is referred to a rheumatologist, usually he or she has already seen a number of other physicians who have diagnosed various conditions, at least one of which is that the condition is psychiatric. Commonly, these patients, who have been contending with chronic discomfort and fatigue, have also become confused, angry and depressed. Thus, it is important not only for the rheumatologist to correctly diagnose the condition, but to gain the patient's confidence as well. The only way to do this takes time, but it is time well spent.The history must be taken in detail: the patient must be encouraged to tell his or her entire story. The patient must be convinced that the physician has appreciated the extent and significance of each symptom. A thorough physical examination should follow, with evident attention to each symptomatic area. The discussion that follows must be complete and compassionate. It is the hardest but the most important part of the consultation, and therefore an example is provided in detail."

The reasons for this persistence can be sought in the history of the concept, which can be approached via quotations from texts written either by authors who describe popular beliefs or their own sufferings; or by physicians known to have played a prominent role in the individualization of rheumatology. The word ""rheumatism"" was first used mainly to designate a painful fluxion of the tissues located between the skin and the internal organs. It gradually lost ground to more descriptive terms suggestive of joints. Thus, the concept of ""rheumatism"" still bears the hallmark of its ""popular"" roots and is on a level parallel to but distinct from that of modern nosography. Awareness of its origins may improve communication between physicians and patients and also raises questions about the foundations of the concept of ""rheumatic disease""."

The Arthritis and Rheumatism Council Low-Dose Glucocorticoid Study Group.,N/A,"Oral glucocorticoids are widely used to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but their effect on joint destruction, as assessed radiologically, is uncertain.
We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial comparing oral prednisolone (7.5 mg daily for two years) with placebo in 128 adults with active rheumatoid arthritis of less than two years' duration. Except for systemic corticosteroids, other treatments could be prescribed. The primary outcome variables were the progression of damage as seen on radiographs of the hand after one and two years, as measured by the Larsen index, and the appearance of erosions in hands that had no erosions at base line. The radiographs were viewed jointly by a radiologist and a rheumatologist who were unaware of the treatment assignment and the time point at which the films were obtained.
The statistical analysis of radiologically detected changes was based on 106 patients for whom there were films obtained at base line and two years later. After two years, the Larsen scores increased by a mean of 0.72 unit in the prednisolone group, indicating very little change, and by 5.37 units in the placebo group, indicating substantial joint destruction (P = 0.004). Of the 212 hands of these patients, 147 (69.3 percent) had no erosions at the start of the study. At two years, 15 of the 68 such hands in the prednisolone group (22.1 percent) and 36 of the 79 such hands in the placebo group (45.6 percent) had acquired erosions (difference, 23.5 percentage points; 95 percent confidence interval, 5.9 to 40.7; P = 0.007). The patients in the prednisolone group had greater reductions than the patients in the placebo group in scores on an articular index and for pain and disability at 3 months; for pain at 6 months; and for disability at 6, 12, and 15 months (all P < 0.05). There was no difference between groups in standardized scores for the acute-phase response. The adverse events were typical of those encountered with antirheumatoid drugs.
In patients with early, active rheumatoid arthritis, prednisolone (7.5 mg daily) given for two years in addition to other treatments substantially reduced the rate of radiologically detected progression of disease."

An increasing body of literature refers to favorable effects of patient education. Patient education improves coping with disease, reduces pain and depression and decreases arthritic ""helplessness"". Therefore, patient education should be a part of the comprehensive care for the rheumatic patient. The patient education group (Arbeitskreis Patientenschulung) of the German Society of Rheumatology (Deutsche Gesellschaft für Rheumatologie) has been initiated to develop a general concept of patient education in rheumatology and to elaborate various patient education programs. The patient education program for rheumatoid arthritis is described as a model for further patient education programs. It consists of six group sessions (modules). The program is conducted by an interdisciplinary team. A group leader is in charge of the program. Train-the-trainer courses should improve the quality of the program. Currently, the patient education group develops education programs for patients with systemic lupus erythematodes and related collagen diseases, spondyarthritis patients, patients with fibromyalgia and rheumatic children and their parents."
442,8906941,1995-06-01,Postcardiac injury rheumatism.,N/A,"The incidence, clinical comparison, laboratory features, therapeutic choices with outcomes of early and late postcardiac injury rheumatism (PIR) were studied prospectively. Out of the 249 patients who survived cardiac surgery, 20 (8%) and 22 (9%) patients had early and late PIR respectively. Earlier onset (within two weeks of surgery), milder articular involvement, absence of constitutional features and laboratory abnormalities and good response to analgesics were characteristics of early PIR. In contrast, late PIR which occurred between the third and fourteenth week after surgery was associated with more marked articular involvement along with systemic and laboratory abnormalities and required longer analgesic therapy, steroid support or prolonged physiotherapy in different combinations. We conclude that two distinct rheumatic syndromes with different clinical dimensions and therapeutic options can occur after cardiac surgery."

Since that time, 11 other patients with this disorder have been identified in the literature, mostly from France. This is a unique syndrome characterized by the sudden onset of symmetric polyarthritis and cutaneous nodules ranging from 5 to 20 mm in diameter, with predilection for the upper and lower extremities. While the cutaneous findings resolve spontaneously after several months, permanent joint sequelae are common.
We present the first two patients with fibroblastic rheumatism reported in the United States. The clinical features and histologic findings were identical to those of patients described in the European literature.
Fibroblastic rheumatism is a relatively rare syndrome characterized by the association of multiple cutaneous nodules with polyarthritis. The clustering of cases in France may, in part, be attributable to increased recognition by clinicians owing to prevalence of reports in the European literature. Perhaps, as clinicians in the United States become familiar with this disorder, further cases will be diagnosed, and the pathogenesis of the disorder will be elucidated."

Coincidence or pathogenic relationship?].,N/A,"Five adults had inflammatory rheumatic disorders 6 to 20 years before the diagnosis of coeliac disease. It is known that joint inflammation occurs in certain patients with adult coeliac sprue who develop either a specific inflammatory rheumatic disease or an atypical progressive polyarthropathy, sometimes as the first manifestation of the intestinal disorder. The diagnosis of adult coeliac sprue should be entertained in these cases even in absence of major digestive disorders or malabsorption. IgA anti-reticulin antibodies and atrophy of the duodenojejunal villosities are the best indicators for diagnosis. There are two important reasons for making the diagnosis of ""asymptomatic adult coeliac sprue"". First a gluten-free diet can improve or even cure the inflammatory joint disease, a rare situation which emphasizes the causal relationship between these two diseases. Second, the risk of developing lymphoma (especially in the small bowel) is apparently lower in patients on gluten-free diet. Pathogenesis is unclear. Frequently the two autoimmune disorders simply appear to coincide in the same patient; more rarely, arthritis is a symptom of coeliac disease. The immunological mechanisms probably begin when antigens cross an excessively permeable intestinal mucosa."

Lost time from work in the rural and urban subjects was 9% and 2.2%, respectively, for PLBS, 5% and 1.1%, respectively for PRSS, and 2% and 1.3%, respectively for epicondylitis. The mean number of lost work days per year in the rural and urban subjects were 15.3 and 21.1, respectively, for PLBS, 8.1 and 15.2, respectively, for PRSS, and 3.9 and 2.3, respectively for epicondylitis. Thus, these forms of soft tissue rheumatism exerted significant effects on community life, apart from causing pain and discomfort. Work days lost directly means diminished income in populations lacking any form of unemployment benefits."

SAP antibodies in high titers persisted from 5 to 12 months in ARF and rheumatic carditis patients especially when RHD was developing. High titers of antibodies to LTA and SLO persisted for 3 months since ARF onset, then fell (p < 0.05). ELISA proved sensitive in determination of antibodies to SAP and LTA. Its combination with determination of the titers to SLO antigens confirmed Streptococcus A infection involvement in emergence of ARF in all the cases including insidious or late-onset carditis and chorea. High levels of antibodies to SAP and LTA were more frequently detected in patients with RHD than in healthy persons (p < 0.001). Correlation between frequency of high levels of antibodies to SAP and bicillin 5 or erythromycin administration, duration of RHD was not established."

Some of RF predisposing factors (female sex, frequent nasopharyngeal infections, poor housing and occupational conditions) negatively affect outcomes of primary RF and contribute to emergence of valvular disease. The initial attack of activity I or III degree, pronounced carditis, active rheumatic process at discharge, recurrences, absence of year-round prophylaxis allow prognostication of valvular heart disease. The majority of the factors promoting valvular and circulatory disorders also contribute to the onset of psychic abnormalities, astheno-organic syndrome, in particular."

The episodes lasted from a few hours up to several days, leaving no residual changes in the joints. After initial observation and treatment, palindromic rheumatism was diagnosed. During the second year of treatment, seroconversion from the rheumatoid factor negative to the rheumatoid factor positive arthritis form was established. In the third year of treatment, erosions of cartilage and bone in the left knee joint were confirmed radiologically. On the basis of the clinical picture, laboratory findings and radiologic changes in the joints, the diagnosis of erosive seropositive rheumatoid arthritis was made. The author stresses that the diagnosis ""palindromic rheumatism"" could be established sooner and more often, particularly if, regarding the typical clinical course and history, the possibility of this disease were taken into consideration at all."

453,7858569,1994-12-15,[Cytokines and anti-cytokines in inflammatory rheumatism].,N/A,"Studies done over the last few years have demonstrated that interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha, which are produced mainly by monocyte-macrophages, are the key mediators of inflammation and tissue destruction in rheumatoid arthritis. The synergistic effects of these factors lead to the production of large amounts of metalloproteases by the synovial cells, chondrocytes, and bone-derived cells. Direct membrane-to-membrane contact between activated lymphocytes and monocyte-macrophages is one of the main factors activating the production of interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha. This activation involves several glycoproteins expressed at the surface of activated lymphocytes (CD11, CD69). Antibodies can partially block this lymphocyte-monocyte interaction. Recent studies have identified two mechanisms capable of inhibiting macrophage and synovial cell activation. One calls into play the antiinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-4 and interleukin-10, which are potent inhibitors of the production of interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and the metalloproteases. Interleukin-10 also activates the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases. The second mechanism, which is more specific, involves antagonists such as the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist and inhibitory soluble fragments derived from the extramembranous portion of the two receptors for tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-sR55 and TNF-sR75). These molecules, which we first studied in their naturally-occurring form, have been cloned and are being tested in several conditions including rheumatoid arthritis. Similar soluble fragments of the receptors for interleukin-1 alpha and beta can inhibit interleukin-1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

CA 19.9 elevation is rarely found in patients without benign or malignant digestive system disease. We studied serum CA 19.9 levels in patients with a variety of inflammatory joint diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (n = 20), lupus, Sjögren's syndrome or U1RNP-associated connective tissue syndrome (Sharp's syndrome) (n = 11), dermatopolymyositis (n = 8), and giant cell arteritis or polymyalgia rheumatica (n = 8). The mean CA 19.9 level in each of these groups was not significantly different from the value seen in a group of patients with osteoporosis. Six patients had persistent marked elevation in serum CA 19.9 levels. Two had Sjögren's syndrome, two had Sharp's syndrome and two had dermatopolymyositis. None of these six patients had evidence of tumoral disease despite a follow-up of several years. Likely explanations for the CA 19.9 elevation were chronic pancreatitis in one case and lung disease in the other five. In patients with lung involvement due to inflammatory joint disease, CA 19.9 elevation may indicate severe disease and may be of use for monitoring the lung condition."

Relevant to the patient are NSAID-induced dyspepsia and ulcer complications such as hemorrhage and perforation. The most important prophylactic means is repeated verification that the NSAID cannot be replaced by other measures, e.g. physical therapy or simple analgesics. If a NSAID is needed, it should be administered at the lowest effective dose. The present drugs used in preventing NSAID-induced ulcers and their complications are far from perfect. Major problems are adverse effects, high costs and insufficient efficacy in the prevention of ulcer complications. Thus, prophylactic antiulcer treatment is recommended in high-risk patients (as a primary prophylaxis) and in patients with previous ulcers (as a secondary prophylaxis). Similar arguments apply for prevention of ulcers in intensive-care patients. Patients at risk are critically ill, those with previous ulcers and in particular those with clotting disorders. Acid-reducing drugs are recommended for nonintubated patients, whereas sucralfate is preferred in patients on artificial ventilation because it is associated with a lower risk for nosocomial pneumonias."

Patients filled in their answers and scores at the start of the visit, after four weeks in Turkey, and three months after returning to Norway. Most of the patients enjoyed better quality of life during the period in Turkey. After three months the effect was considerably reduced. Patients with pronounced symptoms immediately before departure to Turkey benefit more than patients with lighter symptoms. The response to treatment is statistically significant but hardly specific to rheumatic diseases. We could not demonstrate any significant relation between treatment response and age, sex, place of residence in Norway, level of income, education or duration of disease. The placebo effect of this treatment modality presents a problem of priorities.

A randomized, double-blind, parallel-group placebo-controlled study was carried out in two hospital outpatient rheumatology clinics. One hundred and four patients aged 18-75 yr were randomized to receive a non-woven polyester-backed patch supporting a formulation containing 40 mg flurbiprofen 12-hourly over 14 days; or a non-medicated (but otherwise identical) control. Statistically significant differences in favour of the active preparation were seen at both days 7 (P = 0.02) and 14 (P = 0.009) for the investigator's overall opinion of severity of the condition, and at day 7 for the investigator's assessment of pain severity (P = 0.04 intention-to-treat; P = 0.052 N.S. eligible data). The need for further treatment in the form of steroid injections after the trial was greater in the controls (29/44, 66%) than in the flurbiprofen LAT group (17/46, 37%) (chi 2 = 7.54 on 1 d.o.f., P = 0.006). Plasma flurbiprofen levels in 11 patients ranged from 13.4 to 338.7 ng/ml (mean 116; median 57.9). Eight out of 53 (15%) patients receiving flurbiprofen LAT reported a total of 10 adverse events, compared with three out of 51 (6%) reporting seven events among controls. Patients found the patch convenient and soothing. We conclude that flurbiprofen LAT is an effective and acceptable treatment for soft tissue lesions, and should be considered as an alternative therapy to local steroid injection."

Two young women presented with marked eosinophilia, and large, non-tender compressible articular nodules arising from the tenosynovium of extensor tendons, dermatitis, episodic swelling of the hands and/or feet and pain in adjacent muscles and joints. Tissue specimens were examined by routine haematoxylin and eosin staining, immunofluorescent staining for eosinophil granule major basic protein (MBP) and rhodamine-avidin or tryptase staining for mast cells. Plasma levels of MBP and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) were quantitated by immunoassay. The first patient presented in 1967 at the age of 20 and had, in addition to nodules and eosinophilia, dermographism, recurrent episcleritis and axillary urticaria. Biopsy of a nodule showed tenosynovitis with necrotizing granulomas, non-specific vasculitis, eosinophils and eosinophil degranulation as shown by extracellular deposition of eosinophil granule MBP. Her symptoms responded to low-dose, alternate-day prednisone and have remained quiescent over the past 15 yr. The second patient presented in 1990 at the age of 28 with generalized pruritic dermatitis for 15 yr, eosinophilia for 2 yr, subcutaneous nodules and non-limiting pain in several joints. Biopsy of a nodule showed chronic mild tenosynovitis, numerous eosinophils and extracellular deposition of MBP. She remains untreated. Serum IgE values and plasma levels of MBP and EDN were elevated in both patients; mast cells were numerous in their synovial tissue.

The close cooperation between rheumatologists and orthopedists in specific rheumatoid arthritis centers and the recruitment of specially trained therapeutic teams have boosted the recent progress in this field. However, the main responsibility for the patient continues to lie with the rheumatologist. Operative procedures are only considered when despite a well-conducted conservative treatment signs of progressive articular destruction appear; they do not interrupt the conservative management, but are a completion of it. The art of the rheumatology-surgeon reveals itself in his ability to set up a clear-cut therapeutic plan with priorities. In particularly complex cases the indication will require a team discussion, which includes the occupational therapist who has previously assessed the patient's handicap in the performance of ADL and will be centered around the patient, whose motivation is of crucial importance to the success of our efforts. Throughout the many years of active practice and by performing thousands of operations--preventive (e. g. synovectomies) as well as reconstructive ones (e. g. arthroplasties)--we have gained a vast experience in different operative procedures, which we have come to divide into three categories.

FR is characterized by polyarthralgia and joint stiffness without joint destruction, associated with cutaneous nodules and sclerodactyly. Histology shows an increase in the number of fibroblasts and marked dermal fibrosis. Rheumatological and skin manifestations may improve with corticosteroid therapy. In our patient, immunohistochemical studies of involved and uninvolved skin showed an increase in fibronectin and tenascin deposition. In the dermis, the hyperplastic cells had phenotypic features of muscle, suggesting myofibroblastic differentiation. Ultrastructural study showed an increase in active fibroblastic cells with features of myofibroblasts. A hyperproliferative capacity was observed in fibroblasts cultured from involved skin. Biochemical studies of the production of collagen and non-collagen proteins were performed on these cultured cells, and showed a reduction in collagen and non-collagen protein synthesis by FR fibroblasts. Thus, FR appears to differ from other fibrotic skin diseases such as scleroderma, in that dermal fibrosis may be due predominantly to fibroblast proliferation with myofibroblastic differentiation without any increase in collagen synthesis."

It appears that palindromic syndrome is a heterogeneous entity, encompassing other inflammatory conditions at early stages of their evolution, and whose relationship with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is evident but still unclear. Evolution of up to 50% of these cases into otherwise typical RA, commonly accompanied by the conversion to rheumatoid factor seropositivity, the frequent occurrence of nodules, the reported response to RA treatment, and the observation of familial aggregation of the two conditions suggest that PR is part of the spectrum, or a stage in the evolution of RA. However, justification for the distinct existence of PR comes from reports that identify well-defined and recognizable clinical manifestations such as descriptions of the acute attacks, the frequent peri-articular manifestations, the absence of bone and cartilage destruction even after extended periods of time, and the generally good long-term prognosis. Immunogenetic studies with HLA-DR phenotyping and the absence of female preponderance tend to add additional support for the separate identity of PR."

485,1287774,1992-07-01,[Inflammatory rheumatism flare-up after surgical treatment of Cushing's disease: two cases].,N/A,"The anti-inflammatory effect of natural glucocorticoids is often overlooked, as shown by these two cases of inflammatory rheumatism flare-up which occurred after surgical treatment of Cushing's syndrome. The disorder in the first case was exacerbation of a probable rheumatoid arthritis; in the second case an unlabelled inflammatory rheumatism appeared in a context of postoperative corticotropic deficiency. In both cases a purely substitutive hydrocortisone therapy resulted in dramatic regression of the articular symptoms. It is well known that rheumatismal manifestations may occur in patients with slow adrenal failure. The determinant factor seems to be a glucocorticoid deficiency, either isolated or associated with others, since cortisol exerts and anti-inflammatory activity. In patients with corticotropic deficiency following surgical treatment of Cushing's disease, the endogenous corticosteroid therapy of hypercortisolism is interrupted, allowing the aggravation or emergence of inflammatory rheumatism."
486,1596704,1992-06-01,Guidelines on undergraduate curriculum in the UK. Education Committees of Arthritis and Rheumatism Council and British Society for Rheumatology.,N/A,"Symptomatic locomotor abnormalities are common in medical in-patients, form a significant part of a general practitioner's workload, and are the single most important factor influencing disability in later life. That any qualifying doctor should have basic competencies with respect to the locomotor system thus seems appropriate. A survey of medical schools undertaken jointly by the Arthritis and Rheumatism Council (ARC) and British Society for Rheumatology (BSR) in 1990, however, suggests that the locomotor system still has a relatively low priority in undergraduate medical training. In 1990 therefore, the Education Committees of ARC and BSR established a joint working party to define guidelines on an undergraduate curriculum for rheumatology. These guidelines were discussed and developed at a Workshop in Oxford, and circulated to the Deans and Chairmen of Curriculum Committees at all UK Medical Schools in October 1991. It is hoped these guidelines will encourage inclusion of basic rheumatological competencies within the 'core' curriculum for all medical undergraduates."

Taken separately their information value was low. At the same time in patients with O (I), A (II), B (III) blood groups association of antigens were often met that allows to isolate among healthy persons groups of high risk as related to rheumatism with the purpose of realizing primary prophylaxis."

The injury in most of these instances is due to stress failure although occasionally an acute injury with a protracted course in recovery may develop similar symptoms. The most common of these condition are the enthesopathies, that include tendonitis and fasciitis, sprains and strains, bursitis, tenovaginitis and the fibrositis syndrome."
489,1586254,1992-04-01,"Epidemiology of rheumatic diseases in rural and urban populations in Indonesia: a World Health Organisation International League Against Rheumatism COPCORD study, stage I, phase 2.",N/A,"To determine the incidence of musculoskeletal pain, disabilities, and help seeking behaviour, a questionnaire was administered to a rural population of 2184 men and 2499 women and an urban population of 481 men and 590 women aged over 15 years by house to house interviews with completion rates of 95.2% (rural) and 97.1% (urban). The incidences of pain in the joints, back, or neck were 23.6% (rural) and 31.3% (urban). The incidence of disability due to an inability to walk, lift, carry, and dress was 2.8% (rural) and 0.9% (urban). The percentage of the population with pain who had to stop work owing to disability was 75% (rural) and 78% (urban). Official health care facilities were used by 62% (rural) and 71% (urban) of the population. Traditional health care was used by 87% (rural) and 89% (urban). The high percentage of subjects unable to work was due to a predominance of manual labour occupations (rural, 90%, urban, 80%). The age and sex specific incidence of rheumatic diseases in these populations were similar to other developing and developed countries. The primary rheumatology service was inadequate due to the low priority given by the health service to non-communicable diseases and inadequate rheumatology teaching of the primary health care doctors during undergraduate training. Musculoskeletal pain is a major public health problem in Indonesia and is still not fully appreciated."
490,1609235,1992-03-01,[Incidence of signs indicating psoriatic rheumatism in radiological involvement of fingers and toes. Apropos of 193 cases of psoriatic arthropathy].,N/A,"On the basis of 193 cases of psoriatic arthropathy, the authors sought the incidence and rapidity of onset of signs suggestive of this type of rheumatic disorder when there are radiological lesions of the fingers and toes. They conclude that when such radiological lesions exist, signs suggestive of psoriatic arthropathy are frequent (90%), early (85% of cases of psoriatic arthropathy present for less than 5 years) and predominantly involve the distal parts of the fingers and toes (85.5%). The authors consider that the signs which distinguish psoriatic arthropathy from rheumatoid arthritis are due to an extrasynovial process of enthesopathic origin."
491,1598778,1992-03-01,"[Critical considerations of the pathogenesis of ""soft tissue rheumatism"" (fibromyalgia) and its therapeutic consequences].",N/A,"The term ""fibrositis"" for generalized tendomyopathia that can still be found in Anglo-American literature is obsolete. The term implies that the disease has inflammatory qualities and can be treated by antiphlogistic means. Using light or electron microscopy we could find no evidence for an inflammatory process in the either tendon or muscle tissues. The term fibromyalgia makes clear that two totally different tissues are affected: 1. the bradytrophic collagenous connective tissue that requires little oxygen 2. the highly active skeletal muscles, made up of muscle cells that require a high amount of oxygen. The way these two tissues react to disorders therefore is also totally different: The collagenous tendon and capsular tissue react to lack of oxygen and overstrain by excessive formation of fibroblasts and dissolution of collagen fibres. Muscle tissue reacts to nerval irritations by pathological muscle tone in extensive areas of human body. This indurative myoitis does not lead to muscle damage, because the increased demand for oxygen is compensated by an increased supply. In the case of excessive focal contracture in myogelosis the tissue-pO2 sinks below the level vital to the muscle cells. By means of electron microscopy we could detect severe damage to, even dissolution of, myofilaments. Therapy for ""muscular rheumatism"" thus requires normalisation of the pathological tone with the help of antitonic substances or physiotherapy."

Among 15 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with evaluated phenotype, alleles M2 are less frequent and M3 more frequent than in 22 non inflammatory arthropathies (p less than 0.02). Some abnormal phenotype are observed: M2Z (AAT = 1.7) without pulmonary involvement (1 RA); M3S in 2 seronegative spondylarthropathies (1 pulmonary involvement without tobacco intoxication: DLCO/VA: 69% of theoric value; AAT = 1.4); ZZ in a systemic lupus erythematosus with panlobular emphysema and hepatic cirrhosis (AAT = 0.4). An AAT deficiency could explain some pulmonary involvements in chronic inflammatory arthropathies."

496,1414018,1992-01-01,[Rheumatism epidemiology in Europe].,N/A,"The article describes the present and potential of the epidemiology of the rheumatic diseases in Europe, considering especially rheumatoid arthritis (rA) and fibromyalgia (FMA). This is preceded by a short review of the history of European rheuma-epidemiology within the past 40 years. In rA European rheumatologists and epidemiologists have made important contributions to a differentiated nosology, longterm follow up studies and prognostication, conceptualization and measurement of outcomes and the analysis of a possibly decreasing incidence and severity of the disease. In an own study we were able to use the 1987 revision of the ARA-criteria and to test their stability over time. Among 11,534 German residents of Hannover, aged 25-74 we identified 58 with clinically proven rA or undifferentiated arthritis (uA), resulting in an estimated true prevalence of 0.83% (prevalence according) to Rome-criteria 0.53%, ARA-criteria 1987 0.33%). 39/58 could be reexamined after an average of 29 months. Only 9 of 25 ARA-1987-positive rAs maintained their nosological status. The actual care of the total group seemed widely inadequate. The Concept of FMA has been developed in Canada (H. Smythe) and in Germany/Switzerland (W. Müller) at about the same time, in Europe under the notion of ""generalized tendomyopathie"". Whereas the credit for developing and defining FMA-criteria goes entirely to rheumatologists from North America, it is an European privilege to provide first epidemiological data. After Jacobsson's work in Malmö/Sweden we studied in Southern Germany 541 German residents of Bad Säckingen, aged 25-74. We eventually identified 10 subjects with a history of widespread pain, 17+ out of 34 tender points and 2 or less out of 10 control points, giving a minimal FMA-prevalence of 1.9% and an estimated true prevalence of 3.0% (95%-Ci 1.6-4.4%). We identified however several nosologic as well as nosographic difficulties, that question the concept of FMA as an exclusively rheumatological disorder within the spectrum of ""soft tissue"" rheumatism."

By the primary active rheumatic fever (PARF) autoantibodies to the BLSE are revealed. By the recurrent active rheumatic fever (RARF) and in the control sera, autoantibodies reacting with the BLES, apparently, are directed to the rhamnose determinants of APS. These data confirm: different level of antibodies to the GS and to the rhamnose determinants of APS by PARF, RARF and in the control sera; the experiments of the autoantibody inhibition, reacting with the BLSE by the APS or the polysaccharide of streptococci A-variant, containing only the rhamnose determinants."

Felty's syndrome consists of leucopenia (selective neutropenia) and splenomegaly, usually occurring in longstanding classic rheumatoid arthritis. Felty's syndrome can be confused with the more recently recognised rheumatoid arthritis associated large granular lymphocyte proliferative disease. This paper describes a patient with palindromic rheumatism presenting with Felty's syndrome in whom large granular lymphocyte proliferative disease was ruled out by lymphocyte phenotyping."
