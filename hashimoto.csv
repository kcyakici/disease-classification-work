This paper proposes a Hashimoto Thyroiditis ultrasound image classification model HT-RCM which consists of a Residual Full Convolution Transformer (Res-FCT) model and a Residual Channel Attention Module (Res-CAM). To collect the low-order information caused by hypoechoic signals accurately, the residual connection is injected between FCTs to form Res-FCT which helps HT-RCM superimpose the low-order input information and high-order output information together. Res-FCT can make HT-RCM focus more on hypoechoic information while avoiding gradient dispersion. The initial feature map is inserted into Res-FCT again through a down-sampling component, which further helps HT-RCM exact multi-level original semantic information in the ultrasound image. Res-CAM is constructed by implementing a residual connection between a channel attention module and a convolution layer. Res-CAM can effectively increase the weights of the lesion channels while suppressing the weights of the noise channels, which makes HT-RCM focus more on the lesion regions. The experimental results on our collected dataset show that HT-RCM outperforms the mainstream models and obtains state-of-the-art performance in HT ultrasound image classification."

In this study, we analyzed the clinical and ultrasound radiomics(USR) features of TN in patients with HT and constructed a model for differentiating benign and malignant nodules specifically in this population.
We retrospectively collected clinical and ultrasound data from 227 patients with TN and concomitant HT(161 for training, 66 for testing). Two experienced sonographers delineated the TG and TN regions, and USR features were extracted using Python. Lasso regression and logistic analysis were employed to select relevant USR features and clinical data to construct the model for differentiating benign and malignant TN. The performance of the model was evaluated using area under the curve(AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis(DCA).
A total of 1,162 USR features were extracted from TN and the TG in the 227 patients with HT. Lasso regression identified 14 features, which were used to construct the TN score, TG score, and TN+TG score. Univariate analysis identified six clinical predictors: TI-RADS, echoic type, aspect ratio, boundary, calcification, and thyroid function. Multivariable analysis revealed that incorporating USR scores improved the performance of the model for differentiating benign and malignant TN in patients with HT. Specifically, the TN+TG score resulted in the highest increase in AUC(from 0.83 to 0.94) in the clinical prediction model. Calibration curves and DCA demonstrated higher accuracy and net benefit for the TN+TG+clinical model.
USR features of both the TG and TN can be utilized for differentiating benign and malignant TN in patients with HT. These findings highlight the importance of considering the entire TG in the evaluation of TN in HT patients, providing valuable insights for clinical decision-making in this population."
3,37929726,2023-11-06,Network Pharmacology Studies on the Molecular Mechanism of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis Treated with Shutiao Qiji Decoction.,Shutiao Qiji Decoction; Hashimoto Thyroiditis; Network Pharmacology; Molecular Docking;Pathological section,"In recent years, the number of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis has been increasing, and traditional Chinese medicine ingredients and combinations have been applied to treat Hashimoto's thyroiditis to increase efficacy and reduce side effects during the treatment process.
Shutiao Qiji Decoction is one of the Chinese traditional medicine prescriptions, which is commonly used to treat cancer, tumor, etc. It is also used for thyroid-related diseases in the clinic. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease. In this study, the mechanism of Shutiao Qiji Decoction in treating Hashimoto's thyroiditis was studied through network pharmacology and molecular docking verification.
Each Chinese medicine ingredient of Shutiao Qiji Decoction was retrieved from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database. The related genes of HT were searched from the UniProt and GeneCards databases. Meanwhile, we used Cytoscape to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) visual network analysis, and used the search tool to search the database of Interacting Genes (STRING) to build a PPI network. These key proteins were enriched and analyzed by molecular docking validation, Gene Ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Hashimoto's thyroiditis disease model was established in SD rats, and SQD was administered by gavage after the successful establishment of the model. After 6 weeks of continuous administration of the drug by gavage, tissue samples were collected and the thyroid and spleen tissues were visualized by HE staining to verify the therapeutic effect.
The results showed that there were 287 TCM active ingredients, 1920 HT-related disease targets, and 176 drug and disease targets in SQD. Through PPI analysis, GP analysis, and KEGG analysis of the common targets of drugs and diseases, we found their pathways of action to be mainly cancer action pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and T-cell action pathway. The active ingredients of the drugs in SQD, malvidin, stigmasterol, porin-5-en-3bta-ol, and chrysanthemum stigmasterol, were docked with the related target proteins, MAPK, GSK3β, TSHR, and NOTCH molecules. The best binding energies obtained from docking were mairin with TSHR, stigmasterol with TSHR, poriferast-5-en-3beta-ol with MAPK, and chryseriol with GSK3β, with binding energies of -6.84 kcal/mol, -6.53 kcal/mol, -5.03 kcal/mol, and -5.05 kcal/mol, respectively. HE staining sections of rat thyroid and spleen tissues showed that SQD had a therapeutic effect on Hashimoto's thyroiditis and restored its immune function.
It is verified by molecular docking results that Shutiao Qiji Decoction has a potential therapeutic effect on Hashimoto's thyroiditis in the MAPK/TSHR/NOTCH signal pathway, and that the main components, mairin, stigmasterol, poriferast-5-en-3beta-ol, and chryseriol play a role in it. SQD has been shown to have a good therapeutic effect on Hashimoto's thyroiditis."

Our aim was to explore whether the co-existence with HT affects bone metabolism in patients with PHPT.
This was a comparative cross-sectional study carried out in a tertiary inpatient endocrine center from January 2018 through December 2020.
A total of 234 patients were diagnosed with PHPT at our endocrine center. One hundred of them were included in the study - 50 with PHPT only and 50 with PHPT and HT. Two control groups were defined: 37 with HT and 37 without PHPT and HT. Serum markers of calcium-phosphate metabolism, bone markers (RANKL, Osteoprotegerin, β-CTX, Osteocalcin) and interleukin-17A were measured.
The frequency of HT among patients with PHPT was 37.6% (95% CI 31-43%) and did not differ significantly from that in the general population, 32.5% (95% CI 30-35%). Age, BMI, markers of calcium-phosphate metabolism, bone markers and interleukin-17A weren't significantly different in PHPT with and without HT or between the two control groups. The participants with PHPT had higher levels of interleukin-17A, β-CTX and Osteocalcin (p<0.05) than those without the PHPT. RANKL and Osteoprotegerin in these groups did not differ.Interleukin-17A correlated positively with serum calcium, PTH and RANKL and negatively with serum inorganic phosphate and 25(OH)D. Controlling for HT and age did not change the correlation.
In our study, HT has not additional effect on bone metabolism in the patients with PHPT. Higher levels of interleukin-17A in PHPT suggest a possible role in the PTH-induced bone remodeling."

Establishing the diagnosis itself is quite challenging, as symptoms vary among cases and there is still no standard confirmatory test. The clinical presentation is heterogeneous; however, patients with HE most commonly experience focal neurological deficits, frequently accompanied by cognitive dysfunction, aphasia, or paresis. The most widely recommended initial treatment for cases of HE is a course of corticosteroids. Nonetheless, their response varies from patient to patient, and some may become resistant to them. There are many proposed second-line treatments; however, there is little data and no consensus on the best alternative treatment when steroid therapy fails. This article provides an update on a case of cerebellar ataxia in a 30-year-old female patient with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. She initially presented with rapid-onset progressive symptoms of cerebellar ataxia (movement incoordination, dysmetria, and balance problems) and had elevated serum anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. She was diagnosed with HE and was initially treated with methylprednisolone. However, her symptoms recurred after tapering steroid therapy, and eventually, they ceased to manage her symptoms, plus she developed steroid-induced osteoporosis. She began treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as an alternative in April 2022. Since then, she has had four infusions of IVIG that have allowed her to remain symptom-free."

A comprehensive search of the PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases resulted in the identification of nineteen randomised controlled trials and three non-randomised studies for the review; three studies examined the effect of supplementation with vitamin D, twelve studies-with selenium, and seven studies-with other DS. Based on very limited evidence, the lack of influence of vitamin D supplementation on inflammatory parameters was found, while no studies have examined oxidative stress and antioxidant status parameters, and only one provided results for a single thyroid parameter after an intervention. Some evidence was found proving that selenium supplementation may decrease inflammation and improve thyroid parameters, but reaching a conclusion about its influence on oxidative stress and antioxidant status is not possible because of the insufficient number of studies. Additionally, due to examining other DS (e.g., multicomponent, "

Primary thyroid lymphoma (PTL) is rare and has a poor prognosis. The co-occurrence of both malignancies is extremely rare, and the preoperative diagnosis is rather difficult. We report the case of a patient with both PTC and PTL in the setting of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). A 59-year-old female patient was referred to our department for progressive enlargement of the thyroid gland over a few months. The imaging results demonstrated an enlarged thyroid and a mass in the thyroid. Total thyroidectomy and bilateral central neck node dissection were conducted. The final diagnosis of the coexistence of thyroid diffuse large B cell lymphoma and PTC was confirmed by histopathology and immunohistochemistry. The patient received radiation therapy and six cycles of chemotherapy combined with targeted therapy, including rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vindesine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). After 6 months of follow-up, neither tumor has recurred. It is important for physicians to keep PTL in mind for differential diagnosis in HT patients with sudden thyroid enlargement."
9,37861476,2023-10-20,Hashimoto's thyroiditis-related myopathy in a patient with SARS-CoV-2 infection: A case report and systematic literature review.,N/A,"Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is a common autoimmune disease. However, its presentation and management in the context of COVID-19 are unclear, and COVID-19-triggered HT, along with myopathy and persistent creatine kinase (CK) levels, have not been previously reported. Moreover, no literature review is currently available on HT in the context of COVID-19. This study is a case report and systematic review of the literature.
A 33-year-old man was admitted with acute-onset myalgia, anosmia, loss of taste, fever, and upper respiratory tract symptoms.
He was diagnosed with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) during hospitalization and had abnormal CK levels. The elevated CK level persisted even after the resolution of COVID-19. After excluding myopathies and cardiac factors, HT was diagnosed.
CK levels did not decrease appreciably until 14 d after levothyroxine administration.
The patient was discharged from the hospital in good health. In the systematic literature review, 7 case reports on COVID-19-associated HT were observed, although no incidence of associated myopathy or persistent elevation of CK was noted.
This case report highlights the potential link between COVID-19 and autoimmune thyroid diseases. In particular, this study underscores the significance of recognizing new-onset autoimmune thyroid disease in COVID-19-positive patients with elevated CK levels that cannot be attributed to other factors. This systematic review offers additional perspectives for diagnosing and managing HT in COVID-19 settings. Overall, the findings of this study could have important clinical implications for the care of COVID-19 patients, as early identification and treatment of autoimmune thyroid disease could help prevent long-term complications. Additional research is essential to elucidate the fundamental correlations between COVID-19 and HT and assess the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches for autoimmune thyroid conditions related to COVID-19."

In this study, we aimed to analyze the differences and similarities of the metabolic mechanism of PTC in normal and HT background, and to explore the relationship between HT and PTC.
The ultra performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF/MS) technology was used to analyze 61 PTC patient tissues (31 HT background and 30 normal tissue (NC) background). Potential biomarkers were screened from principal component analysis (PCA) to orthogonal partial least square (OPLS) discriminant analysis. HMDB was searched to identify potential differential metabolites and final metabolic pathway analysis was performed by MetaboAnalyst 5.0. We analyzed the differential metabolites diagnostic accuracy through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis.
Seven different metabolites were screened from HT group and NC group, including arginine, glutamic acid, cysteine, citric acid, malic acid, uracil and taurine. Logistic regression model combined with ROC analysis of these 7 biomarkers had good discriminability for PTC (area under operating characteristic curve of HT group and NC group were 0.867 and 0.973, respectively). The HT group had specific metabolic pathways, including aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism.
The metabolic profiles of the NC and HT groups had important similarities and differences in PTC. The correlation of PTC with HT may be related to aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, serine and threonine metabolism."

Studies have reported a wide range of frequencies indicating the presence of EBV in HT, and patients with autoimmune thyroiditis have increased titers of anti-EBV antibodies in their sera compared to healthy subjects. Intrathyroidal EBV-infected B cells may be responsible for the increased risk of development of B-cell lymphoma in the thyroid gland in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis. Our study suggests that regular follow-up is necessary for patients diagnosed with HT and are positive for EBV, as antiviral therapy is not applicable due to the risk of thyroid dysfunction. The study suggests an association between EBV and HT, but causation cannot be determined. The study also highlights the need for further research to determine the viral role and correlate it with the severity and progression of HT."

To illustrate that the intestinal microbiota plays important roles in HT pathogenesis via microbiota-derived H2S levels.
We collected feces from HT patients and healthy donors for fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT). Thirty-six female CBA/J mice were randomized into four groups: experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT) group, EAT + Health group, EAT + HT group, and EAT + HT + H2S group. 16S rRNA sequencing was performed to examine gut microbiota alterations and H2S production pathway. Serum TgAb and H2S levels were assayed by ELISA and H2S-selective sensors, respectively. T-cell subpopulations in the spleen were detected by flow cytometry.
The gut microbiota was different after FMT among the EAT, EAT + Health and EAT + HT groups. The thyroiditis score assessed by H&E staining was higher in the EAT + HT group than that in the EAT and EAT + HT + H2S groups. Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation ratios were increased in EAT + HT group compared to the other three groups. Serum H2S levels were decreased and the dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR) pathway was attenuated in the EAT + HT group compared to the EAT + Health group.

Following identifying SS and HT's shared differentially expressed genes, functional annotation, protein-protein interaction network creation, and module assembly were performed to discover hub genes. H&E staining and immunohistochemistry were performed to validate the expression of the hub genes in salivary glands. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to assess the discrimination of the hub genes as biomarkers in predicting SS, this study applied CIBERSORTx to analyze the immune infiltration in SS and HT in addition. A total of 48 common differentially expressed genes (48 upregulated genes and 0 downregulated genes) were chosen for further investigation. We analyzed the expression and function of PTPRC, CD69, IKZF1, and lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2 via H&E, immunohistochemistry, and ROC analysis. The 4 hub genes were mainly enriched in the T-cell receptor signaling pathway. We then evaluated and verified the diagnosis value of 4 hub genes in clinical minor labial gland biopsy of SS with HT, SS without HT, and non-SS. ROC analysis revealed that the 4 hub genes had a strong diagnostic value. Our study showed the common pathogenesis of SS and HT. These hub genes and diagnostic models may put forward some new insights for diagnosing and treating SS complicated with HT."

This was a single-center, retrospective, cross-sectional study conducted on obese patients aged 18 years and over. The medical records of patients who presented with complaints of being overweight at the obesity clinic between April 2017 and May 2019 were examined. Patients and healthy individuals were included in the study consecutively until the sample sizes reached saturation. Patients with diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic inflammatory disease, and malignancy were excluded from the study. The patients' anthropometric measurements, smoking status, blood examination, and thyroid ultrasounds were evaluated. The difference in means between the groups was calculated using the Mann-Whitney U test.
The study included 179 participants, consisting of 93 patients and 86 healthy controls. The mean age was 46.6±14.1 years, with most females (91.6%). Although the NLR and PLR values in patients were higher than those in the control group, the difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.427 and p=0.089, respectively). Furthermore, no significant difference was observed in NLR (p=0.191) and PLR (p=0.668) values between levothyroxine-treated and untreated patients. Correlation analysis revealed weak positive associations between C-reactive protein and thyroid peroxidase antibodies (p<0.05), neutrophils (p<0.01), platelets (p<0.01), and NLR (p<0.05).
The findings of this study suggest that NLR and PLR may not serve as effective indicators of systemic inflammation in patients with euthyroid HT, nor do they adequately assess the impact of levothyroxine usage on systemic inflammation.

Biopsies for ultrastructural investigations were obtained from the thyroids of five patients with HT after a thyroidectomy. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was utilized to study representative tissue specimens.
Examination indicated interstitial extravasated blood cells and a plethora of plasma cells, based on their subcellular identity landmarks. These antibody-secreting cells were profoundly spotted near follicular cells, fibroblasts, and cell debris entrenched in collagenous areas. Pathological changes persistently affected subcellular components of the thyrocytes, including the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, lysosomes, and other intracellular vesicles. Interestingly, significant endothelial destruction was observed, specifically in the larger blood vessels, while the smaller vessels appeared comparatively unaffected.
Our TEM findings highlight the immune-related alterations occurring within the thyroid stroma. The impaired vasculature component and remodeling have not been described ultrastructurally before; thus, further exploration is needed with regards to angiogenesis in HT in order to achieve successful prognostic, diagnostic, and treatment-monitoring strategies."

It is characterized by symptoms of acute or subacute encephalopathy which usually occur in the presence of elevated levels of antithyroid antibodies. Even though it is also known as steroid responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT), some cases appear to be steroid-resistant. This review examined whether treatment of Hashimoto's encephalopathy with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is associated with better clinical outcomes than the standard therapy. Additionally, we presented a case of a 59-year-old man who presented with severe neurological manifestations and was successfully treated with intravenous immunoglobulin.
The online databases PubMed and EMBASE were searched.
A total of 1,365 articles were identified. After the deletion of 112 duplicates, 1,253 studies were screened by evaluating the title and abstract, focusing on Hashimoto's encephalopathy cases where IVIG were used. 846 studies were excluded because they were not relevant to the topic or included pediatric population. Therefore, 407 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. The final analysis included 14 eligible articles after 393 were excluded (irrelevant texts, not written in English, full-text not available). In the majority of the selected case-reports, IVIG was associated with a good outcome, sometimes even with dramatic improvements in patient's status.
In last years, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy proved its utility in Hashimoto's encephalopathy's treatment, being a well tolerated therapy associated with remarkable improvement in patient's status. Further research is still needed in order to define the optimal treatment protocol for Hashimoto's encephalopathy and to establish if intravenous immunoglobulin can also be used as a first-line therapy, alone or in combination with steroids."

To retrospectively investigate the clinical presentations and treatment outcomes of patients with Hashimoto encephalopathy at Siriraj Hospital.
Patients who presented with acute encephalopathy at our center during July 2012-March 2017 were evaluated for eligibility. The inclusion criteria were positive anti-thyroperoxidase (anti-TPO) or anti-thyroglobulin (anti-Tg) in serum with negative neuronal antibody in serum or cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Clinical presentations, symptom duration, laboratory results of thyroid status and thyroid autoantibody, CSF study, and clinical outcomes were collected.
Of the 204 patients who presented with encephalopathy, 31 (15.2%) were positive for the anti-TPO or anti-Tg antibody. Of those, 13 patients met the diagnostic criteria for Hashimoto encephalopathy. Clinical presentations included cognitive impairment (76.9%), clouding of consciousness (46.2%), and behavior change (30.8%). The neuropsychiatric presentations were visual hallucination (30.8%), auditory hallucination (15.4%), delusion (7.7%), and mood disturbance (23.1%). Other clinical presentations included seizure (38.5%), abnormal movement (23.1%), sleep disturbance (38.5%), ataxia (46.2%), stroke-like episode (15.4%), and fever (15.4%). Most patients (76.9%) had onset within < 3 months. Regarding outcomes, 1 patient who did not receive corticosteroid died from status epilepticus and septic shock. Among the 12 patients who received corticosteroid, 9 (75%) had marked improvement, 1 (8.3%) had slight improvement, and 2 (16.6%) had no clinical improvement. Seven patients (53.9%) had normal thyroid function, 4 patients (30.8%) had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 2 patients (15.4%) had subclinical hyperthyroidism.
The results of this study revealed cognitive impairment, neuropsychiatric symptoms, seizure, ataxia, and sleep disturbance to be common manifestations of Hashimoto encephalopathy. This condition should always be considered in individuals with subacute onset of unexplained cognitive impairment or cerebellar ataxia. Laboratory and neuroimaging investigations were all found to be nonspecific in Hashimoto encephalopathy.

This case demonstrates an uncommon presentation of a large pericardial effusion by showing its relationship to myxedema in a patient with untreated hypothyroidism. CASE REPORT A 42-year-old man with a past medical history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and opioid abuse presented to the emergency department due to altered mental status, for which he received Narcan without resolution of symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain was without any acute intracranial abnormalities to explain the patient's altered mental status. CT chest reported a pericardial effusion, with a subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) showing a moderate-to-large circumferential effusion without right atrial/ventricular collapse and no cardiac tamponade physiology. On further investigation, he was found to have severe hypothyroidism with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies. Endocrinology was consulted to start IV levothyroxine and liothyronine to treat autoimmune Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Subsequent TTE after starting hypothyroidism treatment showed an ejection fraction (EF) of 45-50% with mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function and moderate-to-large pericardial effusion, with no evidence of tamponade physiology. After treatment of hypothyroidism, the thyroid panel, EF, and pericardial effusion improved significantly. CONCLUSIONS This case illustrates the potential for suffering a large pericardial effusion secondary to generalized myxedema in a patient with severe hypothyroidism from undiagnosed Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It is important to recognize this condition for appropriate therapy and prevention of worsening cardiac conditions."

A total of 95 serum samples were collected, including 28 healthy controls (HCs), 28 PTC0 patients and 39 PTC1 patients. Serum samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography-triple stage quadrupole-mass spectrometry (HPLC-TSQ-MS), and twenty-one amino acids (AAs) were detected.
The serum concentration of glutamic acid was significantly elevated in PTC1 patients compared with PTC0 patients. Lysine was the second amino acid that differentiated these two groups of PTC patients. In addition, the serum concentrations of glycine, alanine and tyrosine were significantly reduced in both PTC patient groups compared to the HC group. These AAs were also correlated with thyroid hormones and antibodies. Five amino acid markers, namely, glycine, tyrosine, glutamic acid, glutamine and arginine, separated/distinguished PTC0 patients from healthy subjects, and eight AA markers, the same AAs as above without arginine but with alanine, leucine, valine and histidine, separated/distinguished PTC1 patients from healthy subjects based on ROC analysis.
Compared with the HCs, changes in AAs in PTC0 and PTC1 patients showed similar patterns, suggesting the possibility of a common pathophysiological basis, which confirms preliminary research that PTC is significantly associated with pathologically confirmed HT. We found two AAs, lysine and alanine, that can perform diagnostic functions in distinguishing PTC1 from PTC0."

This research aimed to discover biomarkers and potential treatment targets associated with immune and OS dysregulation in HT through integrated bioinformatics analysis and clinical validations. Differential gene expression analysis of GSE138198 dataset from the GEO database identified 1490 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in HT, including 883 upregulated and 607 downregulated genes. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis explored module genes associated with HT. Overlapping the differentially expressed module genes with immune-related and OS-related genes identified eight differentially expressed module genes associated with immune and OS (DEIOGs) in HT. Protein-protein interaction network analysis identified five hub genes (TNFAIP3, FOS, PTK2B, STAT1, and MMP9). We confirmed four hub genes (TNFAIP3, PTK2B, STAT1 and MMP9) in GSE29315 dataset and clinical thyroid samples, which showed high diagnostic accuracy (AUC >0.7) for HT. The expression of these four genes was positively correlated with serum thyroid peroxidase antibody, thyroglobulin antibody levels, and inflammatory infiltration scores in clinical thyroid samples. Immune profiling revealed distinct profiles in HT, such as B cells memory, monocytes and macrophages. Additionally, all hub genes were inversely associated with monocytes. Further, miRNA-mRNA network analysis was conducted, and a regulatory network comprising four hub genes, 238 miRNAs and 32 TFs was established. These findings suggest that immune cells play a crucial role in the development of HT, and the hub genes TNFAIP3, PTK2B, STAT1, and MMP9 may be key players in HT through immune- and OS-related signaling pathways. Our results may provide valuable insights into the pathogenesis and therapeutic monitoring of HT."

Thus, we aimed to evaluated the metabolic profile of follicular fluid and antithyroid autoantibody levels in the context of Hashimoto thyroiditis. We collected follicular fluid from 61 patients, namely 38 women with thyroid autoantibody positivity and 23 women as negative controls, undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment. Follicular fluid samples were analyzed using metabolomics, and thyroid autoantibodies were measured. Fifteen metabolites with higher concentrations in the follicular fluid samples from Hashimoto thyroiditis were identified, comprising five possible affected pathways: the glycerophospholipid, arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, alpha-linolenic acid, and sphingolipid metabolism pathways. These pathways are known to regulate ovarian functions. In addition, antithyroglobulin antibody concentrations in both serum and follicular fluid were more than tenfold higher in women with Hashimoto thyroiditis than in controls. Our data showed that the metabolic profile of follicular fluid is altered in women with Hashimoto thyroiditis, suggesting a potential mechanistic explanation for the association of this disease with female infertility."

The disease has a complex etiology, with genetic and environmental factors contributing to its development. Vitamin D deficiency has been linked to a higher prevalence of thyroid autoimmunity in certain populations, including children, adolescents, and obese individuals. Moreover, vitamin D supplementation has shown promise in reducing antithyroid antibody levels, improving thyroid function, and improving other markers of autoimmunity, such as cytokines, e.g., IP10, TNF-α, and IL-10, and the ratio of T-cell subsets, such as Th17 and Tr1. Studies suggest that by impacting various immunological mechanisms, vitamin D may help control autoimmunity and improve thyroid function and, potentially, clinical outcomes of HT patients.

The exact pathomechanism behind it has not been clearly established; however, an interplay of genetic susceptibility, environmental triggers (including diet) and epigenetic factors seems to be involved. Among the latter, increasingly more attention has been paid to some hormonally active substances, known as endocrine disruptors, which are commonly used worldwide. HD has become a condition widely reported in the media, acting as a culprit for inexplicable weight gain, chronic fatigue or weakness. Nevertheless, the recognition of HD is undeniably increasing and represents a major public health burden. At the same time, improving access to imaging tests has increased the number of incidentally diagnosed adrenal tumors. Above all, the widespread use of chest computed tomography (CT) due to the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to frequent incidental detection of adrenal lesions. Fortunately, a vast majority of these findings are asymptomatic benign tumors with no excessive hormonal activity, and therefore, they are defined as adrenal incidentalomas (AIs). Interestingly, recent studies have indicated that patients with AIs are more prone to obesity and insulin resistance. Although mutual relationships between the thyroid and the adrenal glands have been studied widely, still, little is known about the possible pathophysiological associations between thyroid autoimmunity and the occurrence of adrenal incidentalomas. This article presents a brief review of the common endocrine disorders with a special focus on the frequently coexisting insulin resistance and/or obesity. Furthermore, in response to the recent growing interest in endocrine disruptors, with their transgenerational epigenetic effects that influence hormonal system function, a concise overview of the topic has also been included."

Ultrasound is the modality for detection, while fine needle aspiration is the gold standard method for diagnosis. Serologic markers, such as antithyroidal peroxidase antibody (TPO) and antithyroglobulin antibody (TG), are usually elevated.
The main objective is to appraise the incidence of neoplasms on a background of Hashimoto thyroiditis. Our second objective is to recognize the different sonographic appearances of Hashimoto thyroiditis, to focus on its nodular and focal patterns, and to measure the sensitivity of the ACR TIRAD system (2017) when interpreted on patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis.
A single-center retrospective cross-sectional study. We studied 137 cases diagnosed cytologically as Hashimoto thyroiditis from January 2013-December 2019. The data collected were analyzed using SPSS (26th edition), and ultrasounds were reviewed by a single board-certified radiologist. The ACR thyroid imaging and Data System 2017 (ACR TI-RADs 2017) and the Bethesda System for reporting thyroid cytology 2017 (BSRTC 2017) were used for reporting ultrasound and cytology, respectively.
The mean age was 44.66 years and the female : male was 9 : 1. Serologically, anti-Tg was high in 22 cases (38%), while anti-TPO was positive in all of the 60 cases studied. Histologically, 11 cases were diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma (8%) and a single case with follicular adenoma (0.7%). Ultrasonographically, 50% of the cases showed diffuse pattern, in which 13% of them showed micronodules. 32.2% were macronodular, and 17.7% were a focal nodular pattern. 45 nodules were interpreted with the ACR TIRAD system (2017), in which 22.2% were TR2, 26.6% were TR3, 17.7% were TR4, and 33.3% were TR5.
Hashimoto thyroiditis is a risk factor for developing thyroid neoplasms, which necessitate a proper assessment of the cytological material studied and a correlation with the clinical and radiological features. Recognizing the different types of Hashimoto thyroiditis and its variable appearances is significantly important in performing and interpreting thyroid ultrasound imaging. Microcalcification is the most sensitive parameter to discriminate between PTC and nodular type of Hashimoto thyroiditis. The TIRAD system (2017) is a useful tool for risk stratification; however, it might create unnecessary FNA studies in the setting of Hashimoto thyroiditis because of its variable appearances on ultrasound. A modified TIRAD system for patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis is important to alleviate this confusion. Finally, anti-TPO is a sensitive marker for detecting Hashimoto thyroiditis, which could be used for future referencing of newly diagnosed cases."

In this case report, we describe the case of an 11-year-old patient who presented with ITP, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), and H. pylori infection. Following anti-H. pylori treatment and thyroxine supplementation, the child's platelet count increased compared to the previous count. The limitation of this report is that the platelet count of this child returned to normal after anti-H. pylori and thyroxine supplementation, so we cannot distinguish the effect of anti-H. pylori and thyroxine supplementation on the platelet count in this child. Despite this limitation, we still believe that early screening for thyroid function and H. pylori, as well as prompt eradication of H. pylori, along with thyroxine supplementation, may be beneficial in treating and improving the prognosis of children diagnosed with ITP."

This study investigates clinically relevant effects of selenium supplementation in patients with HT.
A systematic search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. The latest update was performed on December 3, 2022. We investigated the changes in thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) after selenium supplementation. The effect sizes were expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
After screening and full-text assessment, 7 controlled trials comprising 342 patients were included in the systematic review. The results showed that there was no significant change in TPOAb levels (WMD = -124.28 [95% CI: -631.08 to 382.52], P = .631, I2 = 94.5%) after 3 months of treatment. But there was a significant decrease in TPOAb levels (WMD = -284.00 [95% CI: -553.41 to -14.60], P < .05, I2 = 93.9%) and TgAb levels (WMD = -159.86 [95% CI: -293.48 to -26.24], P < .05, I2 = 85.3%) after 6 months of treatment.
Selenium supplementation reduces serum TPOAb and TgAb levels after 6 months of treatment in patients with HT, but future studies are warranted to evaluate health-related quality or disease progression."

In recent years, MIF (Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor) has been found to promote the secretion of IL-17A and the production and differentiation of Th17 cells. However, the specific mechanism of it remains unclear. Here, we found that the expression of MIF, IL-17A and HVEM (Herpes Virus Entry Mediator) were up-regulated in HT patients. The proportion of Th17 cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was positively correlated with the serum MIF protein level. We further found that the expression of HVEM and the phosphorylation level of NF-κB in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HT patients were significantly increased. Therefore, we speculated that MIF promotes Th17 cell differentiation through HVEM and NF-κB signaling pathways. Further mechanism studies showed that MIF could directly bind to HVEM, and the stimulation of rhMIF in vitro could increase the expression of HVEM and activate NF-κB signaling pathways to promote Th17 cell differentiation. After blocking HVEM with HVEM antibody, the effect of MIF on Th17 cell differentiation disappeared. The results above show that the differentiation of Th17 cells is promoted by MIF combined with HVEM through NF-κB signaling pathways. Our research provides a new theory to the regulation mechanism of Th17 cell differentiation and gives hint to new potential therapeutic targets for HT."

In this review, we use ""HT in the hyperthyroidism stage"" to refer to early HT with clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism. In clinical practice, it is not easy to distinguish between HT in the hyperthyroidism stage and GD as they exhibit very similar clinical symptoms. The current literature lacks so far studies that systematically compare and summarize hyperthyroidism due to HT and GD from varied aspects. It is necessary to focus on all the clinical indices of HT in the hyperthyroidism stage and GD, for accurate diagnosis. Multiple databases such as PubMed, CNKI, WF Data, and CQVIP Data were used to search the literature concerning HT in the hyperthyroidism stage and GD. The information extracted from the relevant literature was summarized and further analyzed. To differentially diagnose hyperthyroidism as HT or GD, it is recommended to first focus on serological tests, followed by imaging tests, as well as the thyroid I131 uptake index. In pathology, fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is the gold standard for the differential diagnosis of HT and GD. Test results from cellular immunology and genetics could also be used to accurately diagnose between the two diseases, which may be further developed and studied in the future. In this paper, we reviewed and summarized the difference between HT in the hyperthyroidism stage and GD from the following six aspects: blood tests, imaging, thyroid I131 uptake, pathology, cellular immunology, and genetics."

Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) prevents AGE-RAGE interaction in a competitive manner.
We investigated the association between serum AGE, sRAGE and thyroid function in 73 Hashimoto thyroiditis patients (HT) on levothyroxine substitution, and in 83 age, BMI and gender-matched healthy controls.
The serum AGEs levels were determined by autofluorescence on a multi-mode microplate reader, and the serum sRAGE levels by ELISA method.
Mean AGE level was lower (10.71 vs 11.45 AU/µg protein; p=0.046), while mean sRAGE level was higher (923 vs 755 pg/mL; p<0.0005) in the serum of HT patients than the controls. AGE correlated with age, while sRAGE correlated negatively with BMI in both groups. We found negative correlation between AGE and fT3 levels (r=-0.32; p=0.006) and sRAGE and TSH levels (r=-0.27; p=0.022) in HT patients, while we failed to find association between AGE, sRAGE and parameters of thyroid function in the control group. Median AGE/sRAGE ratio was lower in HT patients than in controls (2.4, IQR 1.9 - 3.1 vs 3.3, IQR 2.3 - 4.1 AU/pg; p < 0.001). In HT patients, the AGE/sRAGE ratio correlated positively with BMI and correlated negatively with fT3.

In this paper, a HT ultrasound image classification model HTC-Net based on residual network reinforced by channel attention mechanism is proposed. HTC-Net strengthens the features of the important channels by reinforced channel attention mechanism through which the high-level semantic information is enchanced and the low-level semantic information is suppressed. Residual network assists HTC-Net focus on the key local areas of the ultrasound images while pay attention to the global semantic information. Furthermore, in order to solve the problem of uneven distribution caused by large amount of difficult-to-classify samples in the data sets, a new feature loss function TanCELoss with weight factor dynamically adjusting is constructed. TanCELoss function can better assist HTC-Net to transform difficult-to-classify samples into easy-to-classify samples gradually, and improve the balancing distribution of the samples. The experiments are implemented based on data sets collected by the Endocrinology Department of four branches from Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine. Both quantitative testing and visualization results show that HTC-Net obtains STOA performance for early lesions recognition in HT ultrasound images.

Hashimoto thyroiditis is the commonest cause of goitre in iodine-sufficient regions.[1] The aetiology of Hashimoto disease is very poorly understood. Most patients develop antibodies to a variety of thyroid antigens, the most common of which is&nbsp;anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO). Many also form antithyroglobulin (anti-Tg) and TSH receptor blocking antibodies (TBII). These antibodies attack the thyroid tissue, eventually leading to inadequate production of thyroid hormone. There is a small subset of the population, around 10-15% with the clinically evident disease, that are serum antibody-negative.[2][3] The mechanisms underlying the assumption that vitamin D is linked with autoimmunity are not clear but probably are associated with its anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory functions. The dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells originating from bone marrow and also a primary target for the immunomodulatory activity of vitamin D. 1,25[OH]2D has direct immunomodulatory effects at the level of the T cell vitamin D receptor. Together, these immunomodulatory effects can lead to the protection of target tissues, such as thyroid cells in autoimmune diseases. Considering that in HT, a disorder of T cell-mediated immunity, immunologic attack is triggered when thyrocytes express MHC class II surface HLA-DR antigens, a process induced by the production of Th1 type inflammatory cytokines (especially IFN-γ). Moreover, at another stage, after being activated by T cells, B cells' ongoing proliferation might be inhibited and apoptosis might be induced by 1,25[OH]2D. Thus, 1,25[OH]2D might decrease antibodies that react with thyroid antigens. The exact levels of vitamin D that are sufficient to improve the immune regulatory function and lead to an effective immune response, should be investigated. Several clinical studies have reported a low vitamin D status in AITD or HT, indicating an association between vitamin D deficiency and thyroid autoimmunity. If supplementation of the Vitamin D decreased thyroid antibody titres in Vitamin D deficient subjects, in the future Vitamin D may become a part of AITDs' treatment, especially in those with Vitamin D deficiency. [4] So, our study tries to assess any potential therapeutic role of vitamin D in the management of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
Most studies have shown an association between low vitamin D status and pathogenesis of AITD, especially HT. However, there are only few preliminary interventional studies for HT. whether vitamin D supplementation is beneficial for AITD or HT, should be evaluated. Treatment of HT mainly based on thyroid hormone supplementation, so if a beneficial role of vitamin D supplementation is identified/ confirmed, it will be helpful in the treatment of patients with HT and may be a part of treatment of HT patients.
Evaluating the role of vitamin D on an excessive thyroid immune response.
Study area: N.R.S. Medical college and hospital, Kolkata (Department of General Medicine).
1 year (January,2019 to December,2019 Sample size: 100 patients both male and female. Sample Design: Patients attending outpatient dept in N.R.S medical college.
Prospective, hospital based, single centre study.
Newly diagnosed patients (age &gt;18 years and of both sexes) with HT and vitamin D deficiency.
Patients suffering from: Other autoimmune diseases. Chronic illnesses like diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease, malignancy. Pregnancy Study tools: Estimation from serum: TSH. Free thyroxine (FT4) 25 hydroxy vitamin D Anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibody' Study techniques: This is a prospective study conducted in N.R.S Medical college, Kolkata, India. Total 100 adult patients of both sexes diagnosed with HT and vitamin D deficiency (vit D&lt;30 ng/ml)12, having none of the exclusion criteria and getting treatment on out-patient department basis, who gave informed consent were included in our study. Blood samples drawn for anti TPO antibody and 25hydroxy vitamin D from all the participants. The correlations between serum Vit D and anti TPO antibody were measured and presented by correlation coef ficient (r2). Study participants are randomly assigned into two groups by random permuted block. Cholecalciferol supplement given in the dose of 60,000 IU weekly for 8 weeks in one group (n = 50). Another group (n = 50) were given placebo (empty soft gelatine capsule). At the onset of the study, patients were requested to keep their habitual diet and routine level of physical activity throughout the study period and not to take any medication that might affect their reproductive physiology. Compliance to the consumption of supplement and placebo was examined by empty blister packets. However, 2 patients from cholecalciferol group and 1 patient from control group lost to follow up. After 8 weeks blood anti TPO antibody level measured in both the groups (n = 48 &amp; 49 in 2 group). The change in the mean value of anti TPO antibody measured and statistical significance of the change checked. Results considered significant or non-significant when P&gt; or &lt; 0.05, respectively. TSH, T4 measurement Performed with chemiluminescence using ADVIA Centaur XP Immunoassay System. Work plan: Study was done over 12 months. Data collected and compilation done and then statistical analysis done by standard statistical method.
For statistical analysis data were entered into a Microsoft excel spreadsheet and then analyzed by SPSS (version 27.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and GraphPad Prism version 5. p-value ≤ 0.05 was considered for statistically significant. The Negative Correlation was found between Serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (ng/ml) vs Serum TSH (mU/L) which was statistically significant. Distribution of mean serum anti-TPO antibody level (IU/ml) [mean±SD] in both groups before and after intervention <img src=""https://www.japi.org/article/images/2023-01-08_1673190869.png"" style=""width: 274px;""> Reduction of serum anti-TPO antibody level in cholecalciferol group is 30.5% and reduction of serum anti-TPO antibody level in placebo group is 16.5%.
This study is carried out with the total no. of 100 outdoor based patients of diagnosed Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (elevated Anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody) and vitamin D deficiency (vit D &lt; 30 ng/mL)12 in Nil Ratan Sircar medical college and hospital within the mentioned study period. The study focussed on evaluating the role of vitamin D on an excessive thyroid immune response i.e. the effect of vitamin D supplementation on thyroid autoimmunity and that low vitamin D levels and the risk of HT are closely associated and the potential application of vitamin D in the treatment of AITD. The result demonstrates a negative Correlation between Serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (ng/mL) vs anti TPO antibody (IU/ml) which was statistically significant. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r)= -0.775, p value = 0.0001. Goswami et al. conducted a community-based survey on 642 adults to investigate the relationship between serum vitamin D concentrations and thyroid autoimmunity. Their results highlighted a significant inverse association between 25(OH)D3 and TPO Ab levels [40]. This inverse correlation was substantiated in the following studies.[5-8] As regards thyroid function in the context of HT, Mackawy and co-workers demonstrated a strong negative association between serum vitamin D concentrations and TSH levels, leading to speculate that vitamin D deficiency in HT patients could be associated with a progression towards hypothyroidism (TSH &gt; 5.0 m UI/L) [45]. Our study also demonstrates negative Correlation between Serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D (ng/mL) vs Serum TSH (mU/L) and the result was statistically significant. Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) = -0.301, p value = 0.003. So, the results indicate that vitamin D deficiency is a risk factor of Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Mean (mean± s.d.) Serum anti TPO antibody (IU/ml) before intervention was 545.06± 230.82 and after cholecalciferol supplementation the mean value decreased to 378.6± 160.49. So, there is a 30.5% reduction in the mean value of anti TPO antibody level. Difference of mean Serum anti TPO antibody (IU/mL) was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001). In the placebo group the mean Serum anti TPO antibody (IU/ml) (mean ± s.d.) of patients was 686.97± 290.19 and after 8 weeks of placebo the mean value was 573.1 ± 254.09. So, in the placebo group the reduction is only 16.5%. Difference of mean Serum anti TPO antibody (IU/ml) was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001). Therefore, in line with the hypothesis the data contributes clearer understanding that vitamin D supplementation results in a reduction of thyroid autoimmunity. This result also supports the previous research. Simsek et al. prospectively evaluated 82 patients with HT randomized in two groups: the first group treated with cholecalciferol for one month and the second group without vitamin D replacement. Their results showed that TPO Ab and Tg Ab levels were significantly decreased by the vitamin D replacement therapy in the first group [46]. These findings were also confirmed by other prospective studies and randomized controlled trials.[9-11] So, the result of our study clearly indicates that vitamin D supplementation could exert a positive effect on thyroid function as well as thyroid autoimmunity Limitations: Vitamin D status is not measured at the end of 8 weeks because of economic constraints. So, it is difficult to determine the optimal level of vitamin D needed for improving the evolution of this immunological disorder. Cholecalciferol is used in HT patients in our study, although active form calcitriol might be more beneficial as vitamin D binding protein level may affect the conversion of inactive vitamin D form and thus alters its function on immune cells. HT patients with normal vitamin D level have been excluded from the study, so from our study we cannot comment on beneficial effect of vit D supplementation in HT patient with normal vit D level. As we used empiric dose of levothyroxine in both the groups instead of a fixed dose, we could not analyze the potential role of vitamin D supplementation in reduction of serum TSH in HT There is still a gap in the knowledge regarding the potential of vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of HT patients whether vitamin D supplementation will help in decreasing the replacement dose of levothyroxine or whether it will stop the need of levothyroxine replacement if used in early stages of HT.
The 8 weeks randomized; double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial demonstrates a negative correlation between Serum 25 hydroxy vitamin D vs anti TPO antibody level. Treatment with 60,000 IU cholecalciferol weekly for 8 weeks, is associated with significant decrease in antithyroid antibody titers. It also improved serum TSH level compared with the placebo, i.e. supplementary treatment with cholecalciferol seems to have beneficial effects on AITD. However, large multicentre studies are needed to investigate the impact of vitamin D supplementary treatment on meaningful long-term clinical end points in AITD. References Dana L.

We present a case of a patient in whom HT shifted to GD, along with a literature review. A 50-year-old woman with myxedema was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease due to hypothyroidism and the presence of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPOAb) and thyroglobulin (TgAb); she also had thyroid stimulating antibodies (TSAb) without any signs of GD. Although thyroid hormone replacement therapy improved her thyroid function, 2 months later, hyperthyroidism appeared and did not improve after discontinuation of the replacement therapy. The patient was diagnosed with GD, which improved with antithyroid agent administration. To date, only 50 cases regarding conversion from HT to GD have been reported. The median age is 44 years (range, 23-82 years), and the median time of conversion is 7 years (range, 0.1-27 years). The male-to-female ratio of HT conversion to GD is 1:9, closer to that of regular GD (1:10) than that of general HT (1:18). All patients received thyroid hormone replacement therapy for hypothyroidism due to HT. Continuous evaluation of TSAb levels is recommended in HT, particularly in cases of TSAb-positive and those under replacement, since it may help predict conversion to GD. Evaluating the clinical characteristics of patients with HT preceding GD is crucial to ensure appropriate treatment and reduce the risk of adverse events."

HT is also classified as a multifactorial disease, which is caused by an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Current knowledge of HT genetics is still very limited, especially in Algerian population.
We wanted to investigate the association of two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) inside VAV3 and SEPS genes with HT in Algerian population.
We conducted a case-control study that included 100 HT cases and 126 healthy controls that were recruited from three private endocrinology clinics. Two SNPs, rs7537605 and rs28665122 inside VAV3 and SEPS genes were genotyped using real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time PCR). Binary logistic regression model was used to test the association of selected SNs with HT and linear regression model was used to test association of these SNPs with thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb) levels.
Binary logistic regression results revealed no allelic association of the minor allele A between Hashimoto's thyroiditis cases and healthy controls (P=0.896) for the rs7537606 in VAV3 gene. The same observation was reported for the AA (P=0.477), AG (P=0.752) genotypes and for the genotypic models: dominant (P=1.0) and recessive (P=0.555). Also, there was no significant difference in the TT (P=0.230), TC (P=0.717) and allelic distribution of the minor allele T (P=0.859), and the combined models: TT + TC (P=1.0), TC + CC (P=0.138) between patients and controls for the rs28665122 polymorphism of the SEPS1 gene.
This is the first genetic study that investigated the genetic association of rs7537605 and rs28665122 inside VAV3 and SEPS genes in Algerian population. Our results suggest that these two SNPs may not be involved in the pathogeneses of HT since we found no association between them and HT/TPOAb levels. Further research that will include larger sample size is required."

We primarily aim to find whether COVID-19 vaccination could induce potential subsequent thyroid function and mood changes. The secondary aim was to find inflammatory biomarkers associated with risk.
The retrospective, multi-center study recruited patients with HT receiving COVID-19-inactivated vaccines. C-reactive proteins (CRPs), thyroid-stimulating hormones (TSHs), and mood changes were studied before and after vaccination during a follow-up of a 6-month period. Independent association was investigated between incidence of mood state, thyroid functions, and inflammatory markers. Propensity score-matched comparisons between the vaccine and control groups were carried out to investigate the difference.
Final analysis included 2,765 patients with HT in the vaccine group and 1,288 patients in the control group. In the matched analysis, TSH increase and mood change incidence were both significantly higher in the vaccine group (11.9% versus 6.1% for TSH increase and 12.7% versus 8.4% for mood change incidence). An increase in CRP was associated with mood change (p< 0.01 by the Kaplan-Meier method) and severity (r = 0.75) after vaccination. Baseline CRP, TSH, and antibodies of thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) were found to predict incidence of mood changes.
COVID-19 vaccination seemed to induce increased levels and incidence of TSH surge followed by mood changes in patients with HT. Higher levels of pre-vaccine serum TSH, CRP, and anti-TPO values were associated with higher incidence in the early post-vaccine phase."

The purpose of the present study was to evaluate whether cartilage thickness is affected in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis or not in thyroidology.
A total of 61 individuals had been evaluated in this case-control study, including 32 euthyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients and 29 healthy subjects comparable in age, sex, and body mass index. The patients with a history of knee trauma or knee surgery, an additional systemic disease such as diabetes mellitus, or an inflammatory disease like rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and scleroderma had not been included in the study. The thickness of the femoral articular cartilage was measured using B-mode ultrasonography, and the right lateral condyle, right intercondylar area, right medial condyle, left medial condyle, left intercondylar area, and left lateral condyle were also measured.
No statistically significant difference between patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis diagnosis and healthy controls in terms of age, age groups, gender, and body mass index (p>0.05).
As a consequence, no obvious connection between autoimmune markers and cartilage thickness in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis was recognized. Although the diverse manifestation of Hashimoto's thyroiditis could be observed, it seems to be no liaison between thyroid autoimmunity and cartilage thickness."

A girl, aged 13 years and 1 month, was admitted to the hospital due to anemia for more than 4 years and episodic abdominal pain for 1 week. Four years ago, the girl went to a local hospital for ""vitiligo"", and a routine blood test revealed anemia. The lowest hemoglobin (HGB) was 61 g/L, and the blood test revealed iron deficiency anemia. She had no menstrual cramps for 2 months. Urine routine showed protein 3+∼4+ and 258 red blood cells (RBCs)/high-power field. Urine protein was 3,380 mg/24 h. Free thyroxine was low, thyroid-stimulating hormone was >100 uIU/ml, thyroid peroxidase antibody was >1,000 IU/ml, and thyroglobulin antibody and thyrotropin receptor antibody were negative. Pituitary magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass in the sellar region with a uniform signal and a maximum height of about 15.8 mm. The result of the antinuclear antibody was 1:80 homogeneous type, and anti-dsDNA and anticardiolipin antibodies IgA and IgM were slightly higher. Thyroxine and iron were given for 1 month, menstruation resumed, and urine protein and RBC count decreased. After 5 months of treatment, free thyroid function, HGB, RBCs in urine, and pituitary returned to normal. Later, a renal biopsy showed changes in focal proliferative glomerulonephritis, and the girl was diagnosed with lupus glomerulonephritis type III.

The purpose of this study is to examine the association of HT with the risk of renal transplant failure.
We utilized the United States Renal Database System dataset collected from 2005 to 2014 and compared the time from first renal transplant to transplant failure in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients with a HT diagnosis to ESRD patients without a HT diagnosis that underwent renal transplant.
A total of 144 ESRD patients had International Classification of Disease-9 claim codes for HT prior to renal transplant, amongst a total cohort of 90,301 renal transplant patients aged 18-100 and meeting criteria. Patients with HT were significantly more likely to be female, white, and to have a diagnosis of cytomegalovirus compared to patients without. ESRD patients with a HT diagnosis that underwent renal transplant had a significantly increased risk of renal transplant failure compared to those ESRD renal transplant patients without an HT diagnosis. There was a significantly increased adjusted hazard ratio for graft failure in patients with a HT diagnosis compared to those without.
Thyroid health and HT may play a significant role in the development of the increased risk of renal transplant failure observed in this study. Additional studies are needed to investigate the underlying mechanisms for this association."

Variables such as patient age, gender, preoperative serum autoantibody levels, tumor characteristics, and treatment modalities were obtained from medical records. The diagnosis of HT was based either on the presence of a positive result in the pathological examination and/or on antibody positivity. A total of 637 patients [mean±SD age, 44.9±13.5 years; 485 women [76.1%)] were included in the analysis. The overall prevalence of coexistent HT was 22.9% (n=146). The disease-specific mortality associated with DTC was 2.9%. DTC patients with HT compared to those without; have more positive lymphovascular invasion (p<0.001), and lymph node metastases (p<0.001). According to the Kaplan-Meier curves, disease-specific survival rates among DTC patients without HT were significantly higher than patients with HT (log-rank p=0.002). The disease-specific mortality rate was 4.79% in DTC patients with HT, it was 1.43% in those without HT. Hashimoto thyroiditis was not associated with a 10-year recurrence-free survival (p=0.059). Differentiated thyroid cancers with concomitant HT are associated with some aggressive tumor features (such as lymphovascular invasion and nodal metastasis) and lower survival. In staging systems based on tumor risk factors, it may be useful to evaluate the presence of concomitant HT as a prognostic factor."

Due to the diverse factors affecting the etiopathogenesis of this disease (hormonal disorders and genetic and environmental factors), as well as the direct involvement of the immune system, scientists are increasingly willing to undertake research aimed at explaining the impact of the loss of immune tolerance and reactivity of autoantigens on the development of the disease. One of the directions of research in recent years is the role of the innate immune response, particularly Toll-like receptors (TLRs), in the pathogenesis of HD. The purpose of this study was to determine the importance of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) expression on selected populations of immune cells, namely, monocytes (MONs) and dendritic cells (DCs), in the course of HD. Particular attention was paid to the analysis of TLR2's correlation with clinical parameters and the possibility its use as a potential biomarker molecule in the diagnostic process. Based on the obtained results, we found a statistically significant increase in the percentage of all analyzed populations of immune cells, i.e., mDC BDCA-1+CD19-, pDC BDCA-1+CD123, classical MONs CD14+CD16-, and non-classical MONs CD14+CD16+ showing on their surface TLR2 expression in patients diagnosed with HD compared to the healthy volunteers. Moreover, in the study group, we noted a more than 6-fold increase in the concentration of the soluble form of TLR2 in plasma compared to healthy patients. In addition, the correlation analysis showed significant positive correlations between the level of TLR2 expression on selected subpopulations of immune cells and biochemical indicators of thyroid function. Based on the obtained results, we can assume that TLR2 may be involved in the immunopathogenesis of HD."

This case raises the clinical pearl that anti-thyroid antibodies, e.g anti-TPO antibody, can be seen in those with autoimmune encephalopathies other than HE and HE remains a diagnosis of exclusion. It also helps to remind clinicians that a new onset refractory seizure even with temporal lobe changes is not pathognomonic for herpes encephalitis, and although negative serology does not rule out the diagnosis, it is recommended to rule out autoimmune encephalitis as it shares similar clinical and radiological picture."

On the other hand, Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), as part of the spectrum of autoimmune thyroid diseases, is a major cause of thyroid hypofunction worldwide. Several studies have aimed to indicate a possible correlation between PTC and HT over the years. This study aims to investigate the correlation between HT disease and PTC tumor invasion rate.
In the present cross-sectional study, PTC patients with HT were selected among patients referred to the surgical ward of Shariati hospital from 2016 to 2019 and compared in terms of tumor invasion and central LN dissection. Also, a similar group of PTC patients without HT undergoing total thyroidectomy was selected for comparison. The tumor invasion rate was assessed based on invasion indices obtained from postoperative permanent pathology specimens. These indices included tumor type and size, number of involved LNs, lymphovascular involvement, perineural involvement, thyroid capsule involvement, multifocal or unifocal tumor, extrathyroidal proliferation, marginal status, and necrosis. Data were obtained and compared in the two groups with SPSS version 22.0 software.
Based on the postoperative pathology reports, 50 (56.2%) PTC patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis were compared against 39 PTC patients without Hashimoto thyroiditis. No significant difference was found between the two groups regarding tumor invasion factors such as multifocality, lymphovascular invasion, marginal invasion, extrathyroidal invasion, capsular invasion, and necrosis.
HT could not be mentioned as an aggravating factor of PTC invasion based on the invasion factors evaluated in pathology specimens."

The primary outcomes of this study included overall efficacy, effectiveness in treating specific symptoms, and the Traditional Chinese Medicine symptom score. The secondary outcomes included the levels of FT3, FT4, and TSH, the size of the thyroid gland, and any adverse events. The results of the meta-analysis showed that CHM combined with WM has a better curative effect and a more effective reduction in clinical symptoms than WM alone: comprehensive efficacy [OR = 4.83; 95% CI (3.45, 6.76)], syndrome efficacy [OR = 5.95; 95% CI (3.94, 8.99)], TCM symptom score SMD = -1.49; 95% CI (-1.86, -1.11)], FT3 [SMD = 0.59; 95% CI (0.48, 0.71)], FT4 [SMD = 0.59; 95% CI (0.48, 0.71)], TSH SMD = -0.97; 95% CI (-1.35, -0.58)], and thyroid volume SMD = -0.25; 95% CI (-0.34, 0.15)]. The incidence of adverse events between the groups was not significantly different [OR = 1.00; 95% CI (0.14, 7.27)]. Because of the effectiveness of CHM, we support using CHM to improve clinical efficacy in the treatment of HTH. The results of our research suggest that the use of Chinese Herbal Medicine (CHM) in combination with Western Medicine (WM) may result in improved clinical efficacy in the treatment of hypothyroidism (HTH) compared to using WM alone."

Vitamin D (vit-D) is a steroid molecule, mainly produced in the skin, which regulates the expression of many genes. The vitamin D receptor (VDR) is found in most tissues and cells in the body. Many studies suggests that vit-D deficiency, which is common worldwide, could also play an important role in autoimmune diseases, including HT. The aim of our study was to show the potential differences in vit-D levels between healthy women and individuals with hypothyroidism and HT. Additionally, we assessed the correlation between vit-D concentration and the level of TSH and anti-thyroid antibodies in females diagnosed with HT.
The study group included 370 subjects. The group was divided into 3 subgroups: (125 - healthy individuals, 111 - hypothyreosis, 134 - HT). Anthropometric measurements including height and weight were obtained in all participants. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as body weight (in kilograms) divided by the square of body height (in metres). The measurement of the thyroid gland was performed using an ultrasound scan with a 10-MHz linear probe by one endocrinologist (Vivid S60N).
We noticed that a lower level of vit-D was connected with a higher level of TSH in each subgroup. There was also strong, negative correlation between TSH and vit-D levels in all the study groups. Moreover, there was a weak, negative correlation between antithyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO) and antithyroglobulin antibody (anti-TG) and vit-D levels in females with HT regardless of vit-D status: < 20 ng/mL, 20-30 ng/mL, and > 30 ng/mL.
To our knowledge, the current study is the first in Poland to compare vit-D status in healthy patients and patients with hypothyroidism, taking into account the level of antibodies (anti-TPO and anti-TG). The results of our study suggest that vit-D supplementation in patients with hypothyroidism, especially in the course of AITD, although determining its optimal, safe dose requires further research."

The pathogenesis of HE is uncertain. Available evidences point towards an autoimmune etiology due to vasculitis or other inflammatory process. Detection of thyroid antibodies - antithyroid peroxidase and anti-thyroglobulin are essential for diagnosis. Autoimmune encephalitis including Anti-IgLON5 disease needs to be excluded in suspected cases with appropriate tests for neuronal surface antibodies. Detection of thyroid autoantibodies is nonspecific, as these can be detected in some normal individuals and in other autoimmune diseases. In recent years, attention has turned to an aggressive form of Hashimoto's thyroiditis accompanied by elevated serum IgG4 levels in younger males with very high levels of thyroid antibodies. The role of the thyroid autoantibodies in the central nervous system (CNS) tissue damage remains unclear and these can act only as markers for diagnosis. Conversely, they have a role to play in determining the thyroid pathology - more glandular fibrosis associated with thyro-peroxidase antibody than with the thyroglobulin antibody. HE is a syndrome characterized by altered mental status, confusion, hallucinations, delusions, and sometimes seizures, in association with high serum anti-thyroid antibody concentration that is usually responsive to glucocorticoid therapy. Diagnosis requires the exclusion of other causes of encephalopathies and encephalitis including autoimmune encephalitis associated with neuronal surface antibodies and paraneoplastic ones. Diagnosis also is dependent on the demonstration of thyroid autoantibodies in serum. Since there is no direct pathophysiologic link between antithyroid antibodies, Hashimoto thyroiditis and the cerebral syndrome, the nomenclature HE could be misleading. The response to steroids led to a renaming of the syndrome to steroid responsive encephalopathy associated with autoimmune thyroiditis (SREAT), though some cases do not respond to steroids. In recent years, attention has turned to an aggressive form of Hashimoto's thyroiditis accompanied by elevated serum IgG4 levels (IgG4-related disease). This is characterized by a higher incidence in men (5:1) than in women, onset at a younger age, more intense thyroid inflammation and higher antithyroid antibody titters. Such patients have excessive production of IgG4 + plasmacytes, which infiltrate various organs leading to their fibrosis and sclerosis, sometimes resulting in inflammatory tumors. HE is treated with corticosteroids along with treatment of the dysthyroid condition, if any. There are yet no guidelines regarding steroid dose and/or duration."

46 PCOS patients and 46 PCOS patients diagnosed with HT were included in this study. A detailed medical history was taken from all participants. Polycystic ovary image was evaluated as below or above 10 ml and antral follicles were counted by transvaginal ultrasound. Insulin resistance of the patients was evaluated according to the fasting insulin (HOMA) index.
Insulin resistance was found to be associated with fasting insulin, HOMA index, body mass index and right ovarian volume in patients diagnosed with PCOS. Among the patients diagnosed with PCOS + HT, insulin resistance was found to be significantly correlated with fasting insulin, HOMA index, (BMI), (SHBG) and left ovarian volume. An increase in right ovarian volume was found in 37.5% of patients with PCOS without insulin resistance and in 76.3% of patients with insulin resistance. An increase in left ovarian volume was found in 35.7% of patients without insulin resistance diagnosed with PCOS + HT and in 68.8% of patients with insulin resistance.
This study shows that ovarian volume should be evaluated in every PCOS patient in order to predict insulin resistance, which causes long-term metabolic diseases, and that all PCOS patients with increased ovarian volume should be investigated for insulin resistance. In addition, it has been observed that insulin resistance affects left ovarian volume in patients with PCOS + HT, whereas insulin resistance affects the volume of the right ovary more in patients with PCOS. At least one ovary has been found to be affected by long-term metabolic diseases. While there was a greater increase in ovarian volume with the addition of insulin resistance, no significant change was observed in the number of patients with increased ovarian volume (PCOS-58, PCOS + HT-57) with the addition of HT finding."

The volume was larger in male than that in female in overall study population and No-HT group (p = 0.047 and 0.010, respectively). There was no significant difference in any DECT-derived parameters between low (≤ 35 years) and high (> 35 years) age group in all three groups (all p > 0.05). TPOAb and TgAb correlated positively with IC and TIC, and negatively with volume in overall study population (all p < 0.05). TPOAb and TgAb also correlated positively with IC in HT group (p = 0.002 and 0.007, respectively).
DECT-derived parameters of thyroid differed significantly between patients with and without HT. Sex and thyroid function indices could affect the DECT-derived parameters. Aforementioned physiological factors should be considered when analyzing the DECT-derived parameters of thyroid."

Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is one of the immune regulatory genes that correlates with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT). However, studies on CTLA-4 +49A/G in DS children with HT are still limited. We aimed to evaluate CTLA-4 +49A/G gene polymorphism in DS children with HT. This case-control study, conducted from February 2020 to February 2022 at Dr. Soetomo General Hospital, Surabaya, enrolled 40 DS children with HT and 50 healthy children. The DNA sequencing was performed to identify the polymorphism (Sanger sequencing). Thyroid peroxidase antibodies (TPOAb), thyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The mean age of DS children with HT was 1.78 years. Males predominated in the study population. Subjects with GG genotype were diagnosed earliest with hypothyroidism (8 months) compared with other studies. The most common thyroid dysfunction was central hypothyroidism, with TgAb positivity present in all patients. The AA genotype (odds ratio [OR] 0.265, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.094-0.746; P = 0.012) and A allele (OR 0.472, 95% CI 0.309-0.721; P = 0.0002) were significantly more frequent in the control group. The AG genotype (OR 2.65, 95% CI 0.094-0.746; P = 0.003) and G allele (OR 2.116, 95% CI 1.386-3.23; P = 0.003) were more frequent in the DS with HT group. The age of the subjects in this study was younger than in previous studies. The AG genotype and the G allele were more prevalent in the DS with HT group and may be a risk factor in HT development in DS children. Furthermore, the AA genotype may act as a protective factor against HT in DS children."

This study aimed to evaluate the association between human herpes virus 6 (HHV-6) with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
In the present study, 64 samples of thyroid paraffin tissue including 32 samples of thyroid paraffin tissue of healthy individuals as control, and 32 samples of thyroid paraffin tissue of Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients were taken from the pathology department of Loghman Hakim Hospital in Tehran. A questionnaire collected demographic information of patients. After DNA extraction from the samples, the nested-PCR technique was performed using specific primers for HHV-6.
Totally, the HHV6-DNA was found in 34.4% of thyroid tissues of healthy individuals (81.8% female and 18.2% male) and 46.9% of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (73.3% female and 26.7% male). It was found that this difference in virus frequency between the two groups was not statistically significant (P value=0.309). There was also no statistically significant relationship between the prevalence of human herpesvirus type 6 and age or sex.
Based on the present study, the number of HHV-6-infected individuals in Hashimoto's patients and controls did not differ significantly; therefore, HHV-6 appears not to be associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis."

We analyzed the features of HT through bioinformatics analysis so as to identify the markers of HT development. We accessed public microarray data of HT patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under HT. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG-pathway-enrichment analyses were performed for functional clustering of our protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Utilizing ranked gene lists, we performed a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) by using the clusterprofiler R package. By comparing the expression signatures of the huge perturbation database with the queried rank-ordered gene list, a connectivity map (CMap) analysis was performed to screen potential therapeutic targets and agents. The gene expression profile of the HT group was in line with the general characteristics of HT. Biological processes related to the immune response and viral infection pathways were obtained for the upregulated DEGs. The GSEA results revealed activation of autoimmune-disease-related pathways and several viral-infection pathways. Autoimmune-disease and viral-infection pathways were highly interconnected by common genes, while the HLA genes, which are shared by both, were significantly upregulated. The CMap analysis suggested that perturbagens, including SRRM1, NLK, and CCDC92, have the potential to reverse the HT expression profile. Several lines of evidence suggested that viral infection and the host immune response are activated during HT. Viral infection is suspected to act as a key trigger of HT by causing autoimmunity. SRRM1, an alternative splicing factor which responds to viral activity, might serve as potential marker of HT."

It is exceptionally unusual for hypothyroidism to present with AHP. This association can be either primary or secondary through distal renal tubular acidosis. We report two cases who presented with acute quadriplegia. The succeeding investigations revealed severe hypokalemia and autoimmune hypothyroidism. The second case was found to have Sjogren's syndrome additionally. The underlying aetiology of hypokalemia in both cases was found to be dRTA. The combination of such conditions is reported sporadically. Here we also discuss the potential association of AHP with autoimmune conditions by proxy through dRTA.

In this study, 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing technology in combination with the Kruskal-Wallis test, CCA/RDA analysis, Spearman correlation analysis, and other statistical methods were used to analyze the effects of age, gender, hormones, and other environmental factors on gut microbiota by comparing the differences in the microbiota at different stages of HT development.
The results showed that there were differences in the gut microbiota composition between healthy people (HCA) and in patients with HT. Lachnoclostridium, Bilophila, and Klebsiella were enriched in the HCA group, while Akkermansia, Lachnospiraceae, Bifidobacterium, Shuttleia, and Clostriworthdia were enriched in the HT group. Environmental factors analysis revealed that the Bifidobacterium and Klebsiella were two groups of bacteria that have undergone dramatic changes in HCA and HT, and mainly affected by gender. Romboutsia and Haemophilus regulated by the hormone of free triiodothyronine (FT3) may promote the development of HT, while Faecalibacterium and Lachnospiraceae regulated by free thyroxine (FT4) may protect the host.

We aimed to assess the prognostic significance of the serum TgAb in these patients.
This retrospective cohort study included PTC patients and pathologically proven HT from 2007-2016. The Cox proportional hazards model with restricted cubic spline was used to analyze the association between TgAb and structural recurrence, and then survival analysis was performed.
Of 839 patients enrolled, 48 recurrences were identified during a median follow-up of 64 months. Macrocarcinoma and lymph node metastasis were significantly associated with higher TgAb (P = 0.006, 0.002), but no significant difference was found for any other characteristics. An increasing preoperative TgAb level up to 2000 IU/ml was associated with shorter recurrence-free survival(RFS) (P < 0.001), and the 5-year RFS rates in patients with TgAb ≤400, 400-800 and >800 IU/ml were 97.3%, 93.2% and 85.8%, respectively (P < 0.05). The difference was found even after adjusting for potential risk factors (P < 0.001). Of 337 PTC patients who were treated with lobectomy and had available TgAb data at the first year after surgery, a significant decrease (≥50%) in postoperative TgAb was achieved in 41.8% patients, who had a favorable prognosis compared with others (5-year RFS rate 98.5% vs. 92.0%, P = 0.008).
The preoperative serum TgAb seem to effectively stratify PTC patients with concomitant HT who had high risk for recurrence, and the early postoperative trends of TgAb was a good prognostic marker for these patients who treated with lobectomy."

The authors use EMDR therapy (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) to treat trauma disorders. They wondered whether and to what extent this treatment also affects autoimmune processes.
Parallel to the trauma-focused psychotherapy with EMDR, the thyroid hormone substitution dose was documented in patients with active Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroiditis requiring substitution. Hashimoto's autoimmune thyroiditis had already been diagnosed by a specialist and drug treatment had been initiated before starting outpatient psychotherapy.
So far in five cases a decrease in autoimmune activity and a stability of the results in the follow-up between six months and one year could be observed.

In all patients, audiological assessment of hearing (tonal audiometry and impedance audiometry), Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre, caloric test, and kinetic tests (rotary chair test and swing chair test) were evaluated. Thyroid hormone levels [thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4)] and thyroid antibodies [autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and thyroglobulin (anti-TG)] were determined. The relationships between age, weight, height, and BMI and the results of the objective assessment of the vestibular organ were calculated.
In the study group the mean age was 48 years and the mean BMI was 26.425. Normal hearing was found in 15 patients (54%). BPPV (n = 19), followed by Meniere's disease (n = 7) and vestibular neuronitis (n = 2), were the causes of chronic vertigo in this group of patients.

Although growing evidence has shown that selenium can improve the treatment of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT), there is a need to evaluate the association between dietary selenium intake and HT in a large cross-sectional study. This study explored the association between dietary selenium intake and HT based on the National Health reand Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database (2007-2012).
A total of 8756 of 30,442 participants were included in the study. Dietary selenium intake was the independent variable, while HT was the dependent variable. In addition, the relative importance of the selected variables was determined using the XGBoost model. A smooth curve was constructed based on the fully adjusted model to investigate the potential linear relationship between dietary selenium intake and HT. Smooth curves were also constructed to explore the linear/non-linear relationship between dietary selenium intake and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb)/ thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb).
The mean age of the enrolled participants was 44.35 years (± 20.92). The risk of HT was significantly reduced by a 35% per-unit increase in dietary selenium intake after fully adjusting for covariates according to the model (log2-transformed data; OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.51, 0.83). The XGBoost model revealed that dietary selenium intake was the most important variable associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Dietary selenium intake (Log2-transformed) was negatively correlated with TPOAb levels [- 16.42 (- 22.18, - 10.65), P < 0.0001], while a non-linear relationship was observed between dietary selenium intake and TgAb with an inflection point of 6.58 (95.67 μg, Log2-transformed).
Dietary selenium intake is independently and inversely associated with HT risk. Moreover, dietary selenium intake is negatively correlated with TPOAb levels and non-linearly correlated with TGAb levels. Therefore, dietary selenium intake may be a safe and low-cost alternative for the prevention and treatment of HT."

The immune system and bone interact with each other, coined osteoimmunology. Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is one of the most common chronic autoimmune diseases which is accompanied by lymphocytic infiltration. It shows elevating thyroid autoantibody levels at an early stage and progresses to thyroid dysfunction ultimately. Different effects exert on bone metabolism during different phases of HT. In this review, we summarized the mechanisms of the long-term effects of HT on bone and the relationship between thyroid autoimmunity and osteoimmunology. For patients with HT, the bone is affected not only by thyroid function and the value of TSH, but also by the setting of the autoimmune background. The autoimmune background implies a breakdown of the mechanisms that control self-reactive system, featuring abnormal immune activation and presence of autoantibodies. The etiology of thyroid autoimmunity and osteoimmunology is complex and involves a number of immune cells, cytokines and chemokines, which regulate the pathogenesis of HT and osteoporosis at the same time, and have potential to affect each other. In addition, vitamin D works as a potent immunomodulator to influence both thyroid immunity and osteoimmunology. We conclude that HT affects bone metabolism at least through endocrine and immune pathways."

We expect that this treatment will down-regulate B-cell autoreactivity by delivering a strong inhibitory signal. Three peptides-two epitope-predicted ones derived from Tg and another irrelevant peptide-were synthesized and then coupled with monoclonal anti-human CR1 antibody to construct three chimeric molecules. The binding to CD35 on human B cells and the effects of the chimeric constructs on PBMC and TMC from patients with HT were tested using flow cytometry, ELISpot assay, and immunoenzyme methods. We found that after the chemical conjugation, all chimeras retained their receptor-binding capacity, and the Tg epitopes could be recognized by anti-Tg autoantibodies in the patients' sera. This treatment downregulated B-cell autoreactivity and cell proliferation, inhibited Tg-specific B-cell differentiation to plasmablasts and promoted apoptosis to the targeted cells. The treatment of PBMCs from HT patients with Tg-epitope-carrying chimeric molecules affects the activity of Tg-specific autoreactive B lymphocytes, delivering to them a strong suppressive signal."

In this cohort, 1555 patients (37.6%) were diagnosed with HT. According to multivariate analysis, male sex, high levels of TG and TPOAb, tumor extrathyroidal extension, maximum diameter >1 cm, and multifocality were independent risk factors for both central lymph node metastasis (CLNM) and lateral lymph node metastasis (LLNM). In addition, age <55 years and smoking were risk factors for CLNM, while CLNM was one of the risk factors for LLNM. Furthermore, HT was suggested a valuable protective factor for both CLNM and LLNM. In patients with HT, the total number of central lymph nodes was higher, while the positive rate was lower. Compared with those without HT, age and sex did not predict CLNM and LLNM in patients with HT.
HT is considered a protective factor for both CLNM and LLNM in PTC.

From the establishment of the database to August 2022, we searched 2 databases to study the correlation between Hashimoto's and polycystic ovary syndrome. Two authors independently screened the articles for eligibility, and three authors extracted relevant data. Statistical analysis was performed using STATA16.0 software.
A total of 20 studies were included, including 7 case-control studies and 13 cross-sectional studies. A total of 13 countries and 7857 participants were embraced. Studies have demonstrated that both PCOS patients have an increased risk of HT, and meanwhile, HT patients also have an increased risk of PCOS compared with controls. The study also incorporated that the prevalence of HT in PCOS patients in India and Turkey was higher than in other countries, and the prevalence of HT in PCOS patients in South America was higher than in Asia and Europe.
In conclusion, our study illustrates that there is a correlation between PCOS and HT, and it is necessary to further study the underlying mechanism between PCOS and HT. At the same time, it is of great significance to regularly screen PCOS patients for HT risk and HT patients for PCOS risk.

It may not be directly related to thyroid dysfunction as most patients are euthyroid when the symptoms start. There has been a lack of consensus building on the pathophysiology of HE, but most of the evidence points towards autoimmune vasculitis as the underlying process. HE can present as seizures, cognitive dysfunction, tremors, or stroke-like symptoms with focal neurological deficits. Cerebellar ataxia (motor incoordination due to dysfunction of the cerebellum) is seen in HE but is a rare occurrence. The objective of the article was to present a case of cerebellar ataxia in a patient with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. A 30-year-old previously healthy female presented with quickly progressive cerebellar ataxia, bilateral (B/L) limb weakness, and excessive tearing. She was found to have high titers of anti-TPO (anti-thyroid peroxidase) antibodies; a biopsy confirmed Hashimoto's thyroiditis and a battery of negative tests excluding other causes of encephalopathy. Hence, confirming a diagnosis of HE. The patient was given glucocorticoids which relieved her symptoms. After being symptom-free for a few months, she relapsed and was unsuccessfully treated by the steroids. Upon this, she was given IV immunoglobulins, which helped achieve complete resolution. HE can be treated with immunotherapy, and most patients have a good prognosis, but some can have persistent neurological defects if left untreated or treatment is delayed. Relapses are common and may require a more extended treatment regimen."

However, data in the pediatric age group is limited. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the association between serum Cys-C levels and thyroid autoantibodies in children and adolescents diagnosed with euthyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
The patient group was included 50 participants aged between 3 and 18 years, and the control group included 50 healthy children matched for age, gender, and body mass index. Patients with hypothyroidism or taking any medication were not included in the study. Fasting glucose, liver enzymes, urea, creatinine, lipid profile, Cys-C, free thyroxine (fT4), free triiodothyronine (fT3), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), and thyroglobulin antibodies (TGAb) levels were recorded in all subjects.
The mean age of control group was 13.5 ± 2.5 years, and the mean age of Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) group was 14.2 ± 2.7 years, no statistically significant differences existed (p=0.205). Cys-C values were significantly higher in the HT group than in the control group (p=0.041). When all cases were evaluated, Cys-C levels were statistically positively correlated with fT3, TPOAb, and TGAb values (p<0.001, p=0.029, p=0.013 respectively).
Based on the results of our study, Cys-C levels in children and adolescents with euthyroid Hashimoto thyroiditis were statistically higher than their healthy peers. In conclusion, it can be said that Cys-C may be a factor in the etiopathogenesis of autoimmune thyroiditis, and even small changes in TSH values affect Cys-C levels."

The intestine microbiota is strongly associated with autoimmune diseases. Zonulin, a modulator of tight junctions that controls the selective permeability of the intestine can induce an elevation in gut permeability. We aimed to investigate the association of plasma zonulin levels with HT.
We compared 77 HT patients with 66 age-gender and BMI-matched healthy individuals in the case of plasma zonulin levels. Plasma zonulin levels were measured by ELISA. The statistical analyses were performed using Student's t-test and chi-square tests. The predictive power was investigated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis.
We found that the increase in plasma zonulin levels in the HT group was statistically significant compared to the control group (p < 0.001). The regression analysis showed that urea, anti-thyroid peroxidase, aspartate aminotransferase, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free T3, and serum zonulin levels were found to be associated with HT in both univariate and multivariate models (p < 0.05).

The objective of this study was to investigate familial co-aggregation of these diseases and to quantify shared genetic and environmental factors.
This study is a twin cohort study.
National health registers were used to identify cases among 110 814 Swedish twins. Co-aggregation was calculated as risk ratios for type 1 diabetes among co-twins of individuals with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and vice-versa. Variance explained by genetics (i.e. heritability), and the proportions thereof shared between the diseases, was estimated by contrasting associations in monozygotic and dizygotic twins using structural equation models.
Individuals with one disease were at a high risk for the other disease (adjusted risk ratio: 11.4 (95% CI: 8.5-15.3)). Co-aggregation was more common in monozygotic than in dizygotic pairs, with adjusted risk ratios of 7.0 (95% CI: 3.2-15.1) and 1.7 (95% CI: 0.7-4.1), respectively. Genetic effects shared across diseases accounted for 11% of the variance for type 1 diabetes and 9% of the variance for Hashimoto's thyroiditis, while environmental factors unique to individual twins, but shared across diseases, accounted for 10% of the variance for type 1 diabetes and 18% of the variance for Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
Both genes and environment unique to individual twins contribute to considerable etiologic overlap between type 1 diabetes and Hashimoto's thyroiditis. These findings add to the current knowledge on the mechanisms behind autoimmune disease clustering and could guide future research aimed at identifying pathophysiological mechanisms and intervention targets."

Patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis referred to the outpatient endocrinology clinic were included in the study. The demographic data, thyroid function test results, and autoantibody titers were recorded. The headache's clinical characteristics were also determined. The same researcher used the visual analog scale for headache severity rating in all patients.
155 patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis were included the study. There were 95 (61.3%) cases diagnosed with headache consisting of 20 (21.1%) migraine cases, 17 (17.9%) tension type headaches (TTHs), and 20 (21.1%) new daily persistent headaches (NDPHs). 38 of 155 (24.5%) had hypothyroidism related headaches (HRHs). There was no statistically significant relationship between the headache type and a high blood antibody level anti thyroid peroxidase antibody (p=0.135), while a positive correlation was found with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) (p<0.001). Hashimoto patients with migraine (n=14, 70.0%) were found to have higher blood antibody levels, while these ratios were found as 86.8% (n=33) in HRH-patients, 76.5% (n=13) in TTH-patients, and 60.0% (n=12) in NDPH-patients. 86 of 155 (55.5%) patients reported new onset headaches after a Hashimoto's thyroiditis diagnosis, and the headaches persisted without hormone therapy in 48 (84.2%) of these patients. These patients diagnosed with primary headache and this was interpreted as demonstrating comorbidity between Hashimoto's disease and primary headaches.
Detection of only the relationship between TSH level and headache suggested that different mechanisms play a role in the pathophysiology. In the diagnosis of primary headache, it is important to look into secondary reasons."

GSE138198 containing tissue mRNA data and GSE192560 containing lncRNA data were utilized to perform differentially expression analysis. The ceRNA network was constructed based on miRNA-mRNA interactions merging with lncRNA-microRNA interactions. Functional enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis were performed. The mRNA levels of core genes in the PPI analysis in tumor tissues collected from 112 PTC patients including 35 cases coexistent with HT were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR).
A total of 57 genes and 40 lncRNAs, with value of |log2 fold change (FC)|≥ 1 and the adjusted P-value < 0.05, were deemed as differentially expressed genes and lncRNAs between PTC with and without HT. The pathways most significantly enriched by differentially expressed genes between PTC with and without HT were viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptor and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL5, FCGR3A, and CCR2 owned degree values not less than 10 were deemed as core genes differentially expressed between PTC with and without HT. A total of 76 pairs of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA were obtained. Results of qRT-PCR partially demonstrated the bioinformatics results that the mRNA levels of CXCL10, CXCL9, CCL5, and CCR2 were remarkably elevated in tumor tissues collected from PTC patients coexistent with HT than those without HT (P < 0.001).

A remarkable increase trend of rs4077515 AA genotype was found in HT cases in comparison with the control group, while GG genotype frequency exhibited a down trend. An excess of A allele was also detected in HT group. HT cases carrying AG and AA genotypes had high risk to receive hormonotherapy and needed a much larger dose. In comparison with HT cases, both AG and AA appeared more frequently in PTC patients, and are associated with the tumor size, LN metastasis and surgical margin. The AG (OR = 2.566, 95 % CI = 1.376-4.786) and AA (OR = 3.040, 95 % CI = 1.525-6.060) genotype carriers had a greater risk of developing PTC.

Nevertheless, the potential role of XBP1s in amiodarone (AMIO)-treated HT patients remains unknown. In this study, AMIO aggravated the endoplasmic reticulum stress responses in HT patients and thyroid epithelial follicular cells. Moreover, MTT assay and flow cytometry analysis revealed that knockdown of XBP1s suppressed AMIO-induced thyroid epithelial follicular cells apoptosis. Mechanically, the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase activity assay proved that XBP1s enhanced LINC00842 expression in HT patients and thyroid epithelial follicular cells via binding to LINC00842 promoter. LINC00842 functioned as a miR-214 sponge in HT patients and thyroid epithelial follicular cells. Besides, LINC00842 up-regulated Fas ligand (FASL) expression via inhibition of miR-214. In rescue experiments, overexpression of FASL reversed shXBP1s-induced suppression of cell apoptosis in AMIO-treated thyroid epithelial follicular cells.

Recently, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been proposed as reliable markers of oxidative stress in HT. In the present study, we investigated the relationship of AGEs with antioxidant paraoxonase (PON-1) activity as potential combined markers of oxidative stress.
We measured the levels of AGEs, and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) and PON-1 activity by spectrophotometric methods, in the serum of 40 HT patients (36 F; mean age 35.4 ± 11.5 yr) and 38 age-, sex- and BMI-matched healthy controls. All subjects were euthyroid at recruitment and none was on LT-4 therapy.
Serum levels of AGEs were significantly higher (median 378 vs 290 AU/g protein; P<0.001), while PON1 activity was significantly lower (median 165 vs 201 U/L; P<0.05) in HT patients compared to controls: the two parameters were inversely correlated (P<0.01), clearly indicating a pro-oxidant imbalance in HT patients. At stepwise regression analysis, TPOAb positivity was an independent predictor of both PON-1 activity (P = 0.002) and AGEs levels (P = 0.000).
Increased formation and accumulation of AGEs contribute to enhanced oxidative stress, along with a decrease in PON-1 activity in HT. As a consequence, AGEs levels and alteration in PON 1 may serve as useful markers for monitoring the levels of oxidative stress in this disorder."

The patient was noted to have tachycardia at rest, hyperdynamic circulation, and fine tremors on outstretched hands-on examination but no exophthalmos, thyromegaly, or pedal swellings. Her initial laboratory workup revealed thyroid-stimulating hormone of <0.01 mIU/L, with elevated free T3 and free T4 levels. Levothyroxine was held and beta-blockade therapy was started for symptom control. Further workup showed elevated thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin and thyroid receptor antibody levels and normalization of anti-TPO antibody levels. The radioactive iodine uptake scan was initially delayed because the patient underwent a pulmonary angiogram in the ED. A later scan showed thyromegaly with heterogeneous uptake of 82% in both lobes. Hence, the patient was diagnosed with Graves' disease and managed with radioactive iodine ablation therapy. On follow-up, the patient developed post-ablation hypothyroidism; she was started back on levothyroxine therapy and became euthyroid. This case highlights that patients can develop Graves' disease in the background of a hypothyroid state, and this conversion might be postulated secondary to a combination of atypical destructive thyroiditis and a switch of autoantibodies from blocking to stimulating ones.

We present a case of a young female with mosaic TS who presented with altered mental status. The initial workup was negative for stroke and pulmonary embolism and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis did not show any infectious etiology. Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies (Abs) and thyroglobulin Abs were elevated. As the patient's mental status deteriorated, there was a concern for Hashimoto's encephalopathy (HE), hence the patient was started on high-dose IV steroids. Within 24 hours, the patient responded to the IV steroids and an improvement in mentation was noted. HE is a rare immune-mediated disorder, characterized by impaired brain function. The onset of which can be rapid or slowly developing over the course of many years but responds effectively to steroids. Turner syndrome is associated with a high incidence of autoimmune disorders, thus in the setting of a negative workup for more obvious causes, HE should be a consideration when encountered in a clinical scenario."

PTC is well-differentiated cancer that generally has an excellent prognosis. HT is an autoimmune disease that often leads to hypothyroidism. A significant proportion of PTC patients also have HT. This systematic review will analyze the effect of HT on the characteristics and outcomes of PTC. Several databases were systematically searched using relevant medical subject headings (MeSH) keywords and phrases examining the connection between PTC and HT and the effect of their coexistence. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, followed by quality appraisal. After that filtration process, 23 articles were selected with a total of 41,646 patients. Out of 22 studies commenting on tumor size, 12 studies demonstrated it to be smaller in HT patients, while 10 studies observed no effect. Eleven studies examined PTC angioinvasion, most of which found no difference in HT and non-HT patients. However, two studies found angioinvasion to be reduced in PTC patients. As for capsular infiltration, out of the five studies commenting on it, two found decreased occurrence, one found increased occurrence, and two had no difference. Extrathyroidal extension was found to be reduced in seven studies out of the 14 that examined it. Six other studies saw no effect. One study found increased extrathyroidal extension incidence overall, and another found it to be the case in patients younger than 45 years of age. Lymph node metastases were found to be reduced in several studies, while others found no difference. One study found increased central lymph node metastases in HT patients. As for prognoses, most studies found positive aspects. One study found an increased recurrence rate in HT patients, however, it did not have a relationship with deaths. In conclusion, when managing HT or HT and PTC patients, HT patients should be monitored closely for suspicious nodules due to their frequent co-occurrence. Although the effect of HT on PTC has been shown to be mostly protective, multifocality is more common in those patients and, therefore, a total thyroidectomy should be favored. The high false positive rates of lymph node metastases in diagnostic methods should be kept in mind when considering lymph node dissection. Additional diagnostic procedures such as frozen section histology should be considered for verification."

In total, 235 patients with PTC with HT were enrolled in this study, including 101 with CLNM and 134 without CLNM. They were divided randomly into training and validation datasets with a 7:3 ratio for developing and evaluating clinical features plus conventional ultrasound features (Clin-CUS) model and clinical features plus radiomics scores (Clin-RS) model, respectively. In the Clin-RS model, the Pyradiomics package (V1.3.0) was used to extract radiomics variables, and LASSO regression was used to select features and construct radiomics scores (RS). The Clin-CUS and Clin-RS nomogram models were built using logistic regression analysis.
Twenty-seven CLNM-associated radiomics features were selected using univariate analysis and LASSO regression from 1488 radiomics features and were calculated to construct the RS. The integrated model (Clin-RS) had better diagnostic performance than the Clin-CUS model for differentiating CLNM in the training dataset (AUC: 0.845 vs. 0.778) and the validation dataset (AUC: 0.808 vs. 0.751), respectively.

We recruited 1,303 participants, including 866 non-HT controls and 437 diagnosed HT patients. 44 HT patients also had thyroid cancer. Firstly, we compared the difference in thyroid goiter degrees between controls and patients. Secondly, we collected 15 factors and analyzed their significant differences between controls and HT patients, including age, body mass index, gender, history of diabetes, degrees of thyroid goiter, UIC, 25-(OH)D, FT3, FT4, TSH, TAG, TC, FPG, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Thirdly, logistic regression analysis demonstrated the risk factors for HT. For machine learning modeling of HT and thyroid cancer, we conducted the establishment and evaluation of six models in training and test sets.
The degrees of thyroid goiter were significantly different among controls, HT patients without cancer (HT-C), and HT patients with thyroid cancer (HT+C). Most factors had significant differences between controls and patients. Logistic regression analysis confirmed diabetes, UIC, FT3, and TSH as important risk factors for HT. The AUC scores of XGBoost, LR, SVM, and MLP models indicated appropriate predictive power for HT. The features were arranged by their importance, among which, 25-(OH)D, FT4, and TSH were the top three high-ranking factors.

We aimed to evaluate the relationship between SWE values and clinical, biochemical and hormonal parameters of patients with HT and in healthy individuals.
We compared 46 newly diagnosed HT cases with 46 healthy controls. We examined the effect of all metabolic parameters and thyroid-related markers on SWE values.
The mean SWE values in those patients with euthyroid HT were 12.5±5.1 kilopascal (kPa), whereas it was 8.2±2.82 kPa in healthy controls (p<0.001). Although the clinical [age, gender and body mass index (BMI)] and laboratory parameters (such as thyroid function tests, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, insulin-like growth factor-1 values, which we think may affect SWE scores) of those children with HT and the healthy controls were statistically similar (p>0.05), except for their thyroid autoantibodies and thyroglobulin, SWE values and thyroid volume were significantly higher in those individuals with HT (p<0.001). Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the direction and degree of the effect of the variables on thyroid elasticity scores. It was observed that age (p=0.002), BMI standard deviation score (SDS) (p=0.04) and anti-thyroid peroxidase (p=0.008) levels were effective on the thyroid elasticity score in the regression model. We detected a SWE cut-off value of 9.68 kPa with 68% sensitivity and 72% specificity, a 70% positive predictive value, and a 69% negative predictive value in thyroid elastography when differentiating between cases with HT and healthy controls.
Our results show that no metabolic factor other than BMI SDS has any effect on SWE scores, especially in healthy children. There was a positive correlation between BMI SDS and SWE in healthy children (r=0.353; p=0.02), but not in those patients with HT (r=0.196; p=0.19). Likewise, age is another factor affecting SWE only in healthy children. We do not recommend routine evaluation of any laboratory parameters other than thyroid functions before thyroid elastography."

The diagnosis of type 1 diabetes mellitus was placed, and intensified insulin therapy was initiated. Medical history was not of significance except a 5 kg weight loss within 2 months. The patient presented with recurrent episodes of hypoglycemia, and the doses of preprandial and basal insulin were reduced. The differential diagnosis included type 1 diabetes mellitus ""honeymoon"" period or another type of diabetes mellitus. His serological tests only revealed positive autoantibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase 65 and C-peptide. The diagnosis leaned toward latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, and the therapeutic approach involved cessation of preprandial insulin therapy, regulation, and subsequent discontinuation of basal insulin and introduction of metformin. Two years later, basal insulin was reintroduced along with a glucagon-like peptide-receptor agonist and metformin. Further physical examination during the initial visit disclosed upper limb tremor, lid lag, excessive sweating, increased sensitivity to heat, and tachycardia. Laboratory tests were indicative of hashitoxicosis (suppressed level of thyroid-stimulating hormone, high levels of total and free thyroid hormones, positive anti-thyroglobulin and anti-thyroid peroxidase, and negative anti-thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor).

Since oxidative stress (OS) and the inflammatory environment participate in the development of several types of cancer, the objective of the present study was to establish the microenvironment and systemic participation of OS and inflammatory markers in patients with PTC and HT.
Blood and tissue samples were collected from 115 patients: BENIGN (n = 63); PTC (n = 27); HT (n = 15) and PTC + HT (n = 10), and sixty-three were samples from healthy individuals (control group).
Superoxide dismutase, Catalase, reduced Glutathione, markers of lipid peroxidation and inflammation were evaluated in blood. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 3-nitrotyrosine, 4-hydroxynonenal, Ki-67 and VEGF. The results indicate that antioxidant enzymes were more active in groups with thyroid disorders compared to control, while the concentration of Reduced glutathione was reduced in BENIGN and PTC groups. When PTC and PTC + HT groups were analyzed, no significant differences were found in relation to the antioxidant defense and inflammatory markers. The ability to contain the induced lipid peroxidation was lower and a high level of malondialdehyde was observed in the PTC group. All immunohistochemical markers had higher scores in the PTC group compared to PTC + HT.
There was a more pronounced presence of OS and a greater activity of cell proliferation and angiogenesis markers in PTC than in PTC + HT group."

Methods. consecutive patients with HT underwent Lactose Breath Test and clinical/laboratory data collection. Unrelated gastrointestinal disorders were carefully ruled out. Lactose-free diet and shift to lactose-free LT4 were proposed to patients with LI. Results: we enrolled 58 females (age range, 23−72 years) with diagnosis of HT. In total, 15 patients were euthyroid without treatment, and 43 (74%) euthyroid under LT4 (30 of them with a LT4 formulation containing lactose). Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 84.5% of patients, with a greater prevalence in change in bowel habits in lactose-intolerant patients (p < 0.0001). The cumulative LT4 dose required did not differ in patients with or without LI. No significant difference in both TSH values and LT4 dose were observed in patients shifted to lactose-free LT4 and diet at 3 and 6 months compared to baseline. Conclusion: the prevalence of LI in patients with HT was 58.6%, not different from global prevalence of LI. In the absence of other gastrointestinal disorders, LI seems not to be a major cause of LT4 malabsorption and does not affect the LT4 required dose in HT patients."

On the other hand, the imbalance in activity of T cells such as Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg may be relevant in the pathogenesis of this disease. Hence, the assessment of changes in the secretion of cytokines by these cells during selenium supplementation in patients with HT seems to be an important issue and was the main goal of this study. A further aim was to search for correlations among these cytokines, as well as markers of thyroid function, selenium/iodine status in the body, and other biochemical parameters. The group of 29 women with newly diagnosed Hashimoto's thyroiditis was supplemented with selenium in a dose of 100 µg/day for 6 months. Immunological parameters: interferon γ, tumor necrosis factor α, chemokine CXCL10, interleukin 4, interleukin 1β, interleukin 17, transforming growth factor β, and C-reactive protein, as well as selenium status parameters were determined in serum twice, i.e., before and after supplementation. Selenium supplementation was associated with a change in the production of two cytokines: interferon γ and interleukin 1β, for which a decrease and an increase in concentration were observed, respectively. The partial least squares (PLS) model revealed the presence of many relevant correlations among analyzed parameters. The stage of HT development, degree of thyroid dysfunction, and selenium supplementation of diet are interdependent factors which shape the profile of some cytokines secreted by cells participating in the autoimmunity process."

SSc may associate with thyroid autoimmune disorders, with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) being the more prevalent worldwide. Previous studies have examined the behavior of Th17 lymphocytes and Breg cells in patients with HT and concomitant autoimmune organ-specific disorders. These immune phenotypes seem to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of both these autoimmune processes, but their behavior when these two disorders coexist has not been described. We analyzed Th17 and Breg (CD24hiCD38hi) cell subsets in 50 subjects (45F/5M; median age = 49 years): 18 were healthy donors (HD), 20 had isolated HT, and 12 had SSc, seven of whom had both HT and SSc. Breg cells' function was also evaluated by measuring their IL-10 production when stimulated by specific activators. An increased percentage of Th17 lymphocytes characterized HT patients as compared to both HD and the whole group of SSc patients (p = 0.0018). On the contrary, the percentage of unstimulated Breg cells in SSc patients was higher (p = 0.0260), either associated or not with HT, as compared to both HT patients and HD, which, instead, showed a similar percentage of Breg cells. Following a specific stimulation with CpG, the percentages of Breg cells were increased in the whole sample of SSc patients (p < 0.001) as well as in isolated SSc and in SSc+HT ones as compared to isolated HT. However, qualitative analysis, obtained through the detection of the IL-10-producing phenotype, revealed that the percentage of CpG-stimulated CD24hiCD38hi-IL10+cells was significantly decreased in SSc patients (p < 0.0001) with no difference between isolated SSc and SSc+HT patients. The IL-10-producing phenotype was instead slightly increased in HT patients as compared to HD (4.1% vs. 2.8%). The presence of SSc seems to be characterized by an enrichment of total Breg cells but by a reduced Breg IL-10-producing phenotype, representing functional Bregs. This last finding was entirely due to the presence of SSc independently from the association with HT. This behavior is different from the ones described about the association of HT with organ-specific autoimmune disorders."

The expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin was measured in thyroid tissues of healthy volunteers and PTC patients with HT (PTC/HT) or without. The E-cadherin expression was also determined in thyroid cancer cells (TPC1, SNU373, SNU790, 8505C, CAL62, and FTC133). Cell migration was measured by wound healing assay. The expression of N-cadherin, ICAM1, and TGF-β was measured in thyroid tissues and plasma. The E-cadherin expression was significantly increased in PTC/HT patients compared with PTC alone. Meanwhile, the N-cadherin expression was significantly decreased in PTC/HT patients. The E-cadherin expression was only observed in FTC cells, and the overexpression of E-cadherin inhibited cancer cell migration. The TGF-β expression was significantly increased in PTC/HT patients, and the plasma levels were higher in PTC/HT patients than in PTC alone. The expression of N-cadherin and ICAM-1 was significantly decreased in PTC/HT patients. Our results indicate that the expression of E-cadherin and TGF-β was higher in PTC/HT patients than in PTC alone. This suggests that the presence of PTC with HT may attenuate the tumour aggressiveness and metastasis through the up-regulation of E-cadherin and TGF-β expression."

This study aimed to examine a relationship between right and left 2D:4D in women with Hashimoto thyroiditis and Graves' disease. The cross-sectional study included 106 women with autoimmune thyroid disease: 73 women diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis and 33 women with Graves' disease, together with 70 healthy women as controls.

The mean length of right 4D was significantly lower in the examined women with Hashimoto thyroiditis than in Graves' disease. Higher right and left 2D:4D in women with Hashimoto thyroiditis suggests that prenatal exposure to high levels of estrogens relative to testosterone may play a role in the development of this disease. Lower right and left 2D:4D in women with Graves' disease suggest a role of high prenatal androgens relative to estrogens in Graves' disease pathogenesis."

Independent predictors determination by logistic univariate regression analysis were analyzed. The diagnostic value of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and threshold concentration were determined by ROC curve.
In T2DM with HT group, levels of PTH, HbA1c were lower and levels of TSH were significantly higher, when compared with T2DM group. But there was no significant difference in vitamin D between these two groups. In both logistic univariate regression analysis and multiple logistic regression analysis, TSH, HbA1c were independent predictors for T2DM with HT. Based on the ROC curve, the best cut-off value of the TSH was 4 mIU/L (sensitivity 72.7%, specificity 94.6%, AUC = 0.832) for predicting T2DM with HT in T2DM patients.
TSH has increased risk for T2DM evolving into T2DM complicated with HT, so it is important to monitor the concentrations of TSH in patients with T2DM.

Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) is one of the most common endocrine autoimmune disorder, but the role of increased intestinal permeability in its pathogenesis is still being studied.
This pilot cross-sectional study investigates serum zonulin concentration in adults with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and assesses the relationship between zonulin levels, clinical hormonal and immunological characteristics.
A group of 62 adults with HT participated in this study and were divided into three groups: hypothyroid (n=33) euthyroid (n=25) and hyperthyroid (n=4). Serum zonulin was determined using an ELISA method.
Age, gender and BMI were different between groups (hypothyroid and euthyroid ones). Serum zonulin values ranged from 2.6 to 198.0 ng/mL in participants. A direct positive correlation was found between serum zonulin levels and weight and BMI (r = 0.351, p = 0.008 and r = 0.236, p = 0.05, respectively).
There is no correlation between zonulin and thyroid hormones or autoantibodies in Hashimoto thyroiditis patients. There is a difference in zonulin levels between the studied groups, but they are not statistically significant."

It is characterized by increased levels of antibodies against thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin. In this review, we present the metabolic profile, the effectiveness of micronutrient supplementation and the impact of dietary management in patients with HT. For this current literature review, the databases PubMed, Cochrane, Medline and Embase were reviewed from the last ten years until March 2022. This article provides a comprehensive overview of recent randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and clinical trials. Many patients with HT, even in the euthyroid state, have excess body weight, metabolic disorders, and reduced quality of life. Due to frequent concomitant nutritional deficiencies, the role of vitamin D, iodine, selenium, magnesium, iron and vitamin B12 is currently debated. Several studies have underlined the benefits of vitamin D and selenium supplementation. There is still no specific diet recommended for patients with HT, but a protective effect of an anti-inflammatory diet rich in vitamins and minerals and low in animal foods has been suggested. There is insufficient evidence to support a gluten-free diet for all HT patients. Pharmacotherapy, along with appropriate nutrition and supplementation, are important elements of medical care for patients with HT. The abovementioned factors may decrease autoantibody levels, improve thyroid function, slow down the inflammatory process, maintain proper body weight, relieve symptoms, and prevent nutritional deficiencies and the development of metabolic disorders in patients with HT."

The thyroid samples were extracted for single-cell RNA sequencing, whole transcriptome, full-length transcriptome (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), and metabolome sequencing. Identification of immune cells with dysregulated gene expression and abnormal metabolic signaling was performed in the microenvironment, both at the bulk and single-cell levels.

The immune repertoire of T cells was identified on 24 tumor samples and 12 normal samples from 12 patients using TCR high-throughput sequencing. The results demonstrated that the numbers of CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in PTC without coexistent HT (PTC-WO) were significantly lower than those in PTC with existing HT (PTC-W). In PTC-W, the density of CD4+ TILs were generally higher when compared with CD8+ TILs. Furthermore, we found that the numbers of CD3+ T cells and their CD4+, CD8+ subtypes in tumor samples were generally higher than those in normal tissue in PTC-WO and moreover, the number of CD3+ T cells was negatively associated with TCR clonality in PTC-WO. In addition, although ITH of the TCR repertoire truly existed in PTC-W and PTC-WO, the TCR repertoires between distinct regions of the non-adjacent tumor foci were presented with a higher degree of similarity than those between tumor and matched normal tissue in PTC-WO, yet the similarity of intratumor repertoires was not significantly higher than those between tumor and corresponding normal samples in PTC-W. This research comprehensively delineated the quantity and TCR repertoire ITH of T cells in PTC-W and PTC-WO, suggesting that TILs might be reactive to tumor antigens in PTC-WO.

This study was performed to investigate the potential effect of histone deacetylase 6-specific inhibitor (HDAC6i) on Th17 cell differentiation in animal model and the underlying mechanism.
Experimental autoimmune thyroiditis (EAT) mouse model was established by subcutaneously immunization of porcine thyroglobulin (pTg) and adjuvant, and the HDACi Tubastatin A (TSA) or HDAC6i (ACY-1215) was intraperitoneally injected into mice in the following. The histological examination and immune analysis in EAT mice were carried out. Next, the CD4+ T cells were isolated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of EAT mice followed by Th17 cell differentiation assay. The associated factor levels, and the protein interaction between HDAC6 and PKM2 were examined. Subsequently, the effect of STAT3 activation on Th17 cell differentiation was explored.
ACY-1215 or TSA treatment reduced lymphocytic infiltration and alleviated thyroid tissue injury in EAT mice. Correspondingly, either ACY-1215 or TSA treatment reduced the levels of anti-thyroglobulin (Tg), anti-thyroid peroxidase (TPO), IL-17A, and IFN-γ in the serum, decreased Th17 cell differentiation, but enhanced TGF-β level and promoted Treg cell differentiation. In vitro, after induction of Th17 cell differentiation from CD4+ T cells, HDAC6 activity and Th17 cell differentiation were significantly decreased when treated with ACY-1215 or TSA. HDAC6 could interact with PKM2, and HDAC6 overexpression promoted the phosphorylation of STAT3 and PKM2 nuclear translocation. Furthermore, the STAT3 activator treatment reversed the effects of ACY-1215 or TSA treatment.
HDAC6i suppresses Th17 cell differentiation and attenuates HT via PKM2/STAT3 axis."

We aimed to report the case of a type 1 diabetic patient converting from Hashimoto's thyroiditis to Graves' disease after the fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine, thought to trigger an autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA syndrome).
A thirty-one-year-old female patient with type 1 diabetes and Hashimoto's thyroiditis applied to our clinic with complaints of palpitations, anxiety, and weight loss one month after the fourth dose of COVID-19 vaccine (2 doses of CoronaVac + 2 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech). She was receiving levothyroxine 50 mcg/day. When her thyroid function tests showed thyrotoxicosis, we initially considered thyroxine-related exogenous thyrotoxicosis. However, we considered Graves' disease upon persisting thyrotoxicosis despite thyroxine withdrawal, positive serum TSH receptor antibody titers, and other imaging findings. Therefore, various autoimmune and inflammatory events have been reported after the COVID-19 vaccination. Adjuvants in vaccines can trigger autoimmune events, which lead to ASIA syndrome. COVID-19 vaccines may cause increased TSH receptor antibody levels or change the balance in the activity of blocking and stimulating antibodies, which may cause a conversion from Hashimoto's to Graves' disease.
This was the first case report where the patient experienced a conversion from Hashimoto's to Graves' disease after COVID-19 vaccination, which may ultimately be related to ASIA syndrome. Yet, more data is needed to elucidate such a relationship, and patients should closely be checked regularly after four doses of vaccination."

Thyroid sections from all patients were collected to detect IgG4 and IgG expression by immunohistochemical staining.
The IgG4 HT patients were significantly younger than those in the PTL group (39.68 ± 10.95 vs 66.20 ± 10.23 years, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences in the sex distribution or TgAb- or TPOAb-positive rates. The PTL group had a higher prevalence of clinical hypothyroidism than the IgG4 HT group (P = 0.016). In the PTL group, thyroid lesions were more likely to exhibit hypoechogenicity (6/6 vs 1/19, P < 0.001) on ultrasound images. In the PTL group, two patients met the immunohistochemical cut-off value of the criteria for IgG4 HT.
Simply relying on immunohistochemistry for IgG4 cannot diagnose IgG4 HT correctly when a patient presents with rapid thyroid enlargement. A combination of clinical and pathological analyses will help distinguish IgG4 HT from PTL which may be with abundant IgG4-positive plasma cells."

The aim of this study is to investigate whether or not that the changes occurring in the skin of patients with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (HT) predispose to demodex infestation.
Seventy-eight patients being followed for a diagnosis of HT at Kocaeli University Endocrinology Outpatient Clinic, between January 2019 and March 2020, constituted the patient group. The control group consisted of 41 patients who did not have any chronic systemic or dermatological disease and were shown to have no thyroid disease by laboratory tests. Demodex intensity in the malar regions of the patient and control groups was determined using the standardized skin surface biopsy (SSSB) method and compared with each other.
HT patients were significantly more likely to have increased demodex density and suggestive SSSB results than the controls (p < 0.001, p = 0.012, respectively). A significant correlation was found between demodex intensity and the findings of xerosis (p = 0.010, p = 0.011) and spiny follicular papules (p = 0.008, p = 0.008) in the patient or control groups, respectively. However, a significant correlation was identified between the demodex density and the symptoms of burning-stinging (p = 0.028), and feelings of dryness (p = 0.018) roughness (p = 0.028) only in the control group.
Xerotic skin and/or impaired immune responses as a result of autoimmune changes in patients with HT may lead to secondary demodicosis."

We hypothesized that activated microglia might disrupt synapses, resulting in cognitive disturbance in the context of euthyroid HT, and designed the present study to test this hypothesis.
Experimental HT model was induced by immunizing NOD mice with thyroglobulin and adjuvant twice. Morris Water Maze was measured to determine mice spatial learning and memory. The synaptic parameters such as the synaptic density, synaptic ultrastructure and synaptic-markers (SYN and PSD95) as well as the interactions of microglia with synapses were also determined.
HT mice had poorer performance in Morris Water Maze than controls. Concurrently, HT resulted in a significant reduction in synapse density and ultrastructure damage, along with decreased synaptic puncta visualized by immunostaining with synaptophysin and PSD-95. In parallel, frontal activated microglia in euthyroid HT mice showed increased engulfment of PSD95 and EM revealed that the synaptic structures were visible within the microglia. These functional alterations in microglia corresponded to structural increases in their attachment to neuronal perikarya and a reduction in presynaptic terminals covering the neurons.
Our results provide initial evidence that HT can induce synaptic loss in the euthyroid state with deficits might be attributable to activated microglia, which may underlie the deleterious effects of HT on spatial learning and memory."

The association between PTC and HT was found in 180 patients (41.4%), mostly represented in the female group (78.9%), with a lower median age than patients with PTC without HT. In comparison to patients with PTC alone, the PTC-HT group had less invasive and smaller tumours, as well as less lymph node involvement. Moreover, tumours of patients with PTC-HT were diagnosed earlier. Our data showed that Hashimoto's thyroiditis may be considered a protective factor when PTC develops.

Patients with only antiperoxidase antibodies presented with higher TSH levels than subjects with only antithyroglobulin antibodies (p 0.027) but with similar FT4 levels and thyroid score. Prevalence of seronegative Hashimoto's thyroiditis in this cohort was 12.3% (19/154).

The most important and interesting point in this case is that, if we did not check her thyroid-associated antibodies, we could not have diagnosed her as APS. From the data of this case, we assumed that the patient suffered from APS type 3A, 3B, and 3D variants. This case pointed out very clearly the importance of testing for thyroid-associated antibodies under various autoimmune disease conditions even if the thyroid hormone levels are euthyroid. Moreover, based on the strong linkage between inflammatory bowel disease and T1DM and the compatibility with both T1DM and APS type 3, we think it is possible that Hashimoto's disease is present under complicated conditions together with UC and T1DM.

In the present study, we detected the differentially expressed lncRNAs between tumor tissues of patients with PTC with or without HT through lncRNA microarrays. The data were verified and analyzed through qRT-PCR, cell viability, cell cycle and bioinformatics analyses. We found that 1031 lncRNAs and 1338 mRNAs were abnormally expressed in 5 tissue samples of PTC complicated with HT [PTC/HT (+)] compared with 5 samples of PTC without HT [PTC/HT (-)]. Gene Ontology and pathway analyses of the mRNAs suggested that several biological processes and pathways, particularly immune system processes, were induced in the PTC/HT (+) tissues. Twenty lncRNAs were verified in 31 PTC/HT (+) and 64 PTC/HT (-) specimens by qRT-PCR, and the results were consistent with the microarray data.

These medicines are common in treatment of schizophrenia. Thus, HPRL is often observed in schizophrenic patients. It is also known that HPRL can occur in Hashimoto's thyroiditis due to prolactoliberin effect of thyroliberin. The clinical pathophysiology of the patients with the comorbidity of schizophrenia and Hashimoto's thyroiditis, receiving antipsychotics, is of special interest. It's fair to assume that these patients have higher risks of HPRL. To analyze risks of HPRL with antipsychotic treatment, to identify an association between the antipsychotic therapy (AT) and HPRL in Hashimoto's patients receiving AT, to explore the association of HPRL and other laboratory parameters in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and schizophrenia during AT.
We studied 17 patients with HT in comorbidity with schizophrenia receiving AT (mean age 46.5±12.8 years), all euthyroid or with light hypothyroidism. Different laboratory parameters such as anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin (anti-TG) antibodies, blood levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3) and prolactin (PRL) were analysed.
The study revealed the high levels of PRL, anti-TPO and anti-TG autoantibodies. Thus, patients were classified into 3 groups by the degree of expected HPRL risk from the antipsychotics used: without expected risk, with low and high expected risks. The correlation analysis detected an inverse significant correlation (R=-0.51; p=0.037) between expected level of drug-associated HPRL risk and actual PRL levels in studied group. At the same time, we detected a positive significant correlation between the levels of PRL and FT4 in the groups (R=0.53; p=0.03). The correlations between the levels of PRL and other parameters such as TSH, FT3, anti-TPO, anti-TG, anti-TSH receptor antibodies were not statistically significant.
HPRL in the group was not associated with taking of antipsychotic drugs with high expected HPRL risk. Yet, a significant positive correlation existed between the levels of PRL and FT4. Hence, in Hashimoto's thyroiditis accompanied with treated mental illness there are some non-iatrogenic stimulants of prolactogenesis. It cannot be ruled out that antipsychotics may interfere with prolactin metabolism, which creates a false effect of a positive correlation between prolactin and free thyroxine levels, in contrast to common HPRL of hypothyroidism."

The consequential thyroid infiltration by lymphocytes, potentiated by antibody‑mediated autoimmune response through the antibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPOAbs), leads to a destruction of thyrocytes. The presence of TPOAbs is associated with a 2 to 4‑fold increase in the risk of recurrent miscarriages and preterm birth in pregnant women. The clinical presentation of HT includes: (A) thyrotoxicosis, when stored thyroid hormones are released to circulation from destroyed thyroid follicles; (B) euthyroidism, when preserved thyroid tissue compensates for destroyed thyrocytes; and (C) hypothyroidism, when thyroid hormone production by the affected thyroid gland is insufficient. The management of Hashitoxicosis is based on symptoms control usually with β‑blockers, euthyroidism requires periodical thyroid stimulating hormone measurements to assess for progression to hypothyroidism, and hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The dose of levothyroxine (LT4) used for treatment is based on the degree of preserved thyroid functionality and lean body mass, and usually ranges from 1.4 to 1.8 mcg/kg/day. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against therapy with triiodothyronine (T3), apart from in pregnancy when only levothyroxine is indicated, as T3 does not sufficiently cross fetal blood‑brain barrier.

The important role of thyroid-specific circRNAs in HT attracted much attention but without any report revealed their expression profile and function in plasma of HT. In this study, the circRNA expression profile in plasma of HT was explored for the first time by using Arraystar CircRNA Microarray technology. We obtained 22 differentially expressed circRNAs (fold change ≥ 2.0 or ≤  - 2.0, p < 0.05) in plasma of HT, including 7 upregulated circRNAs and 15 downregulated circRNAs. By constructing circRNA-miRNA-mRNA competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network, we found that upregulated circRNAs may function as ceRNAs and affect the occurrence or development of HT through chemokine signaling pathway (p < 0.0001), HIF-1 signaling pathway (p = 0.02), and FoxO signaling pathway (p = 0.04). Notably, hsa_circ_0008193 verified by RT-qPCR were the major upregulation circRNAs involved in the chemokine signaling pathway.

The aim of the study was to analyze and describe available knowledge regarding the effect of gluten or a gluten-free diet on thyroid autoimmunity in HT with or without celiac disease.
Potentially applicable records were obtained through review and analysis of the PUBMED (MEDLINE) and Google Scholar database by using the following phrases: 'hypothyroidism gluten', 'Hashimoto gluten' and 'thyroiditis gluten'. If a record focused on the subject by title and abstrakt, the full paper was screened. Authors' scientific achievements and references of eligible records were screened for possibly omitted studies. The review was focused only on human studies.
Gluten exclusion might increase the risk of HT development because of the potential nutritional deficiencies related to the low quality of gluten-free products. Gluten intake from crops grown on selenium-depleted soil increases the risk of HT development. Only a few studies suggest that GFD would be beneficial for HT patients, even without the coexistence of CD. The strongest connection between gluten intake and thyroid destruction seems to be based on a mechanism of molecular mimicry between gut and thyroid tissue transglutaminase.
Studies conducted so far do not support the claim that HT patients should eliminate gluten from their diet. In view of the limited number of studies, with major limitations and ambiguous results, a gluten-free diet is not recommended."

The aim of the study was to compare the body composition of female patients diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease (HD) and the body composition of healthy women who have never been treated before due to thyroid diseases.
The study involved 47 women diagnosed with Hashimoto disease (HD) and 65 women declaring good health. Body mass and height and body composition analysis using bioelectrical impedance analysis were performed using the TANITA multi-frequency segmental body composition analyzer. Variables having a distribution similar to the normal distribution were analyzed by the analysis of variance (ANOVA), otherwise the Kruskal-Wallis test was used.
Women with Hashimoto disease were characterized by significantly higher values of body weight, and thus BMI index, than healthy women (respectively 73.64 kg vs. 64.36 kg, p <0.0001; 27.65 kg/m2 vs. 23.95 kg/m2, p <0.001).The problem of excess body fat in the body statistically significantly more often affected women with Hashimoto disease than healthy women (44.7% vs. 13.8%, p <0.001).
The results regarding the weight and composition of the patients treated for thyroid disease indicate the need for further in-depth analyses. Even small abnormalities of the thyroid function in the range of reference values may result in the development of many adverse changes in the body."

A total of 44 proteins with differential expression were identified in HT patients, and these proteins play vital roles in cell adhesion, cell metabolism, and thyroxine synthesis. Combining patient clinical trial sample information, we further compared the transient changes of gene expression regulation in HT and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) samples.

Studies using transgenic mice indicated that renal GPX3 biosynthesis depends on Se supply by hepatic SELENOP, which is produced in protein variants with varying Se contents. Low Se status is an established risk factor for autoimmune thyroid disease, and thyroid autoimmunity generates novel autoantigens. We hypothesized that natural autoantibodies to SELENOP are prevalent in thyroid patients, impair Se transport, and negatively affect GPX3 biosynthesis. Using a newly established quantitative immunoassay, SELENOP autoantibodies were particularly prevalent in Hashimoto's thyroiditis as compared with healthy control subjects (6.6% versus 0.3%).

Current studies have reported the coexistence rate between HT and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is quite high. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of HT on the predictive factors of central compartment lymph node metastasis (CLNM) in PTC.
A retrospective investigation was performed on PTC patients. They were subclassified into HT and non-HT groups. The results of preoperative neck ultrasound (US) examinations were reviewed. The clinical characteristics and the predictive value for CLNM were explored and compared between the two groups.
A total of 756 patients were included in this study. There were more female patients (86.1%) in the PTC coexistent with the HT group than non-HT group. The patients with HT group had higher preoperative serum level of TSH. There was statistically significant difference between the HT patients and non-HT patients in nodular vascularization. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that male, age ≤45 years old, tumor diameter >1 cm, and presence of suspicious central compartment lymph node on US, irregular nodular shape, multifocal carcinoma were independent predictive factors of CLNM in PTC patients. It was showed that male, age ≤45 years old, tumor diameter >1 cm, multifocality, and presence of suspicious central lymph node on US were risk factors for CLNM in non-HT patients. Only tumor diameter >1 cm and presence of suspicious central lymph node on US were independently correlated with CLNM in HT patients. The sensitivity of the multivariate model was 63.5%, and specificity was 88.9% for prediction CLNM in HT patients. For non-HT patients, the AUC was 80.6%, the sensitivity of the multivariate model was 64.5%, and specificity was 85.2.
PTC combined with HT is more common in women, and TSH level in HT group is higher than that in patients with PTC alone. Regardless of that HT is not a related risk factor of CLNM in PTC, our result suggested that different predictive systems should be used for HT and non-HT patients respectively to have a more accurate evaluation of CLNM in clinic."

The values of SWE (in kPa) were compared between cases and controls and were also correlated with various demographic variables and serum thyroid hormone concentrations.
The overall median of SWE values in cases and controls was 20.6 kPa (IQR = 19.16-26.94) and 10.7 kPa (IQR = 9.9-16.32), respectively, and the difference was statistically significant (W = 438.5, P < .001). There was a moderate positive correlation between serum triiodothyronine concentrations and SWE (ρ = 0.57, P = .016) and a moderate negative correlation between serum thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations and SWE (ρ = -0.54, P = .020).

There is a significant difference between SWE values of thyroid in normal children and children with newly diagnosed HT. Hence, SWE may be used as a noninvasive imaging technique in distinguishing normal and abnormal thyroid gland at an early stage. We suggest larger studies to confirm our preliminary findings of SWE in pediatric HT."

Additional molecular analysis using mtCOI confirmed the identification of the specimens as Austinograea rodriguezensis Tsuchida Hashimoto, 2002. The megalopal stage of A. rodriguezensis shows similarities and distinctions between the characters of two other bythograeid megalopae, Bythograea thermydron Williams, 1980, and B. microps Saint Laurent, 1984. Unlike other brachyuran megalopae, B. thermydron and A. rodriguezensis lack long serrate setae and stout serrate spines on the dactylus of the fifth pereiopod. In both species no coxal spines on the pereiopods were observed. The elliptical carapace of B. thermydron is broader than long vs longitudinally rectangular in A. rodriguezensis. This carapace shape resembles B. microps more than B. thermydron, however, the dorsal surface of B. microps carapace is densely covered in short setae vs only covered with short setae on the anterior 1/4 and the posterior 1/6 length of carapace in A. rodriguezensis. Furthermore, the amount of plumose natatory setae on the pleopods in B. microps is in total larger and more variable, than in A. rodriguezensis. Bythograeid megalopae seem quite generalized and miss specific features that reveal them distinctively as endemic vent crab. A distinction from other species is possible by observing the unique combinations of certain characters.

IgG4-related Hashimoto thyroiditis (IgG4-RHT), also called IgG4-related thyroiditis, shares many features with IgG4-RD but is distinct in several ways. A case of IgG4-RHT in a 51-year-old African American female is assembled together with a literature review which uncovered 82 cases of IgG4-RHT. The findings and criteria which the respective authors used to reach their diagnoses are analyzed. Findings common to all studies are lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and IgG4-positive staining, while most describe follicular atrophy (95.2%, 79/83). Stromal fibrosis involving >33% of thyroid architecture was reported in 74% (58/78) of cases. While few reports observed storiform fibrosis, all describe lack of obliterative phlebitis or systemic involvement. Discrepancies between reports exist in immunostaining thresholds, as well as grading systems for stromal fibrosis. Based on our review of the literature and experience, we propose a set of best practice recommendations for the diagnosis of IgG4-RHT. Our diagnostic criteria are (1) lack of extrathyroidal IgG4-RD, (2) the fibroinflammatory process should not extend beyond the thyroid capsule, (3) stromal fibrosis comprises at least 30% of the involved tissue, (4) >30% IgG4/IgG ratio, with absolute immunostaining cutoffs varying by the degree of stromal fibrosis: for >50% stromal fibrosis use >20 IgG4+PCs/HPF, for 30% to 50% fibrosis use >30 IgG4+PCs/HPF, (5) fibrosis infiltrates the interlobular/interfollicular space, (6) features of follicle injury, and (7) obliterative phlebitis is not required."

The study included 1188 nodules (HT: 358, non-HT: 830) with known final diagnoses. We found that the strongest indications of nodule's malignancy were microcalcifications (OR: 22.7) in HT group and irregular margins (OR:13.8) in non-HT group. Solid echostructure and macrocalcifications were ineffective in patients with HT. The highest accuracy of nodule's shape criterion was noted on transverse section, with the cut-off value of anteroposterior to transverse dimension ratio (AP/T) close to 1.15 in both groups. When round nodules were regarded as suspicious in patients with HT (the cut-off value of AP/T set to ≥1), it led to a three-fold increase in sensitivity of this feature, with a disproportionally lower decrease in specificity and similar accuracy.

The aim of this study was to explore if basal Ct levels are influenced by the presence/severity of HT or correlated with clinical phenotypes of HT patients.
We included 467 HT patients and 184 control participants, from Croatian Biobank of HT patients (CROHT), in this retrospective study. Calcitonin levels between HT patients and controls were compared using Mann-Whitney test. Ct levels between two subgroups of HT patients, divided by intake of levothyroxine (LT4) therapy, were additionally tested to take into account the illness severity. Spearman rank correlation test was used to analyze correlations between Ct levels and 14 relevant phenotypes.
We have not detected significant differences in median Ct levels between HT patients and controls (2.2 vs 2.35 pg/mL, respectively, P = 0.717) nor in-between two subgroups of HT patients (P = 0.347). We have not detected statistically significant correlations between Ct levels and clinical phenotypes, although we identified three weak nominal correlations: negative correlation of Ct with TgAb in all HT patients (r = - 0.1, P = 0.04); negative correlation of Ct with age in subgroup of HT patients without LT4 therapy (r = - 0.13, P = 0.04); positive correlation of Ct with BSA in subgroup of HT patients on LT4 therapy (r = 0.16, P = 0.042).
Our results suggest that HT patients of all disease stages preserve Ct production as healthy individuals and there is no need for Ct measurements in the absence of a nodule. Additional confirmation and clarification of observed nominal correlations are needed due to potential clinical relevance of TgAb and age-dependent Ct decrease in HT women."

We retrospectively reviewed clinical, imaging, laboratory, thymic pathology, and outcome data that were obtained from medical records of patients with MG and concomitant HT, to whom a thymectomy was performed for a suspected thymic lesion. All the surgical interventions were done in the Third Clinic of Surgery, St. Spiridon Emergency County Hospital, Iaşi, Romania, for an 11 years' period, i.e., from January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2010.
Four patients (three females and one male) were included. The mean age of the patients at the time of their thymectomy was 40.25 years. Of all patients, 75% had moderate or severe MG, 100% had anti-AChR antibodies, and an electromyographic decrement greater than 25%. All patients have been diagnosed with HT in their past medical history by a full thyroid panel [high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) values, low free thyroxine (fT4) values, and the presence of the anti-thyroid antibodies] and all of them have been treated with Euthyrox. Our four patients expressed different MG subtypes, each of them being associated with different thymus pathology. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) scan revealed heterogeneous mediastinal masses and established the correct diagnosis only in 25% of cases. The pathological exams also revealed a heterogeneous pattern of thymic lesions. In contrast with other studies, our patients with MG with anti-AChR antibodies and concomitant HT presented atrophic thymus more frequently (50%), but with particular morphological changes of Hassall's corpuscles. Also, 25% of cases were diagnosed with thymic lympho-follicular hyperplasia (TLFH) associated with thymic epithelial hyperplasia. In B2 thymoma, neoplastic epithelial cells expressed cytokeratin 19 (CK19) immunoreactivity, high Ki67 labeling index and strong p63 immunopositivity.
In our series, MG and HT occurred simultaneously, or one of them was diagnosed before the other, raising some new questions regarding the immune mechanism of these two autoimmune diseases. Due to the heterogeneous morphological changes of the thymus that we found in this study, we can hypothesize that thymus is involved in the pathogenic mechanism of MG with anti-AChR-antibodies and concomitant HT development."

At presentation, one patient had euthyroidism, ten had hypothyroidism, seven had subclinical hypothyroidism, and one had hyperthyroidism. The most common reasons for doctor's visits were thyroid enlargement (21.1%), global developmental delay (21.1%), and routine thyroid function tests in patients with type 1 diabetes (26.3%). Sixteen patients provided follow-up data, and the mean follow-up time was 23.31 ± 16.44 months (range 1-48 months). In the hypothyroidism group, one patient stopped levothyroxine (LT4) treatment after 2 months; the remaining patients had been treated with LT4 since their diagnosis. In the subclinical hypothyroidism group, one patient whose thyroid function returned to normal after 1 month of being diagnosed was not treated. The remaining patients received LT4 treatment at their diagnosis or during follow-up. The patient with hyperthyroidism was treated with methimazole after diagnosis, but treatment was discontinued 11 months later and LT4 was initiated 26 months after diagnosis. One in four patients with global developmental delay approached normal mental development after LT4 treatment. Four in six patients with short stature achieved height catch-up.
At their initial HT diagnosis, most of the children showed hypothyroidism or subclinical hypothyroidism. Children with global developmental delay require continual screening, even if the thyroid function is normal after birth, to determine whether they have HT-induced hypothyroidism. Thyroxine replacement could partially relieve the clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism and early diagnosis and treatment are essential for improving patient prognosis."

With the progressive destruction of the organ, the thyroid gland shrinks in size, thus commonly leading to hypothyroidism. Therapy of HT is mainly focused on managing the thyroid dysfunction by oral substitution of L‑thyroxine. However, patients with HT often complain about a broad spectrum of symptoms, with some of them hardly explained by HT itself. Several other disorders are known to be associated with HT. The etiology of HT seems to be multifactorial, including environmental influences such as iodine supply, infections, and stress as triggers of immune modulation. In addition, also a genetic background based on changes of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) status seems to be evident. The paper will provide an overview of diseases related to HT, including their correlation to certain HLA patterns. This presentation should give a broader view on HT-related disorders and facilitate detailed examination and management of patients with HT.

Mit zunehmender Organzerstörung nimmt die Größe der Schilddrüse ab, die Folge ist eine Schilddrüsenunterfunktion. Die Therapie der HT zielt vorrangig auf die Normalisierung der Schilddrüsenfunktion bei eingetretener Hypothyreose durch orale Gabe von L‑Thyroxin ab. Patienten mit HT schildern jedoch oftmals ein breites Spektrum an Symptomen, die durch die HT selbst nur schlecht erklärbar sind und die auch nach Normalisierung der Schilddrüsenfunktion anhalten. Diverse andere Erkrankungen sind bekanntlich mit HT vergesellschaftet. Die Pathogenese der HT erscheint nach heutigem Wissensstand multifaktoriell zu sein. Jodzufuhr, Infektionen, Stress wurden als Einflussfaktoren identifiziert, die eine Immunmodulation mit Entstehung einer HT hervorrufen können. Ein genetischer Einfluss in Zusammenhang mit dem human leukocyte antigen(HLA)-Status wurde ebenfalls als einer der ursächlichen Faktoren für HT ermittelt. Die vorliegende Arbeit gibt eine Übersicht über Erkrankungen, die mit HT assoziiert sind, sowie deren Korrelation mit dem HLA-Status.

The objective of this work was to describe the interactions of the cell subpopulations that participate in HT. To achieve this goal, we generated a mathematical model that allowed the simulation of different scenarios for the dynamic interaction between thyroid cells, the immune system, and the gut microbiota. We used a hypothetical-deductive design of mathematical modeling based on a system of ordinary differential equations, where the state variables are the TH1, TH17, and Treg lymphocytes, the thyrocytes, and the bacteria from gut microbiota. This work generated a compartmental model of the cellular immune response occurring in the thyroid gland. It was observed that TH1 and TH17 lymphocytes could increase the immune cells' activity, as well as activate effector cells directly and trigger the apoptosis and inflammation processes of healthy thyrocytes indirectly. Likewise, the model showed that a reduction in Treg lymphocytes could increase the activity of TH17 lymphocytes when an imbalance of the gut microbiota composition occurred.

In our study, we tried to find key genes and potential molecular mechanisms of Hashimoto's thyroiditis to provide new ideas for the therapeutic targets of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.
GSE138198 and GSE54958 were downloaded from the GEO database, and two datasets were combined for analysis. The combined data were normalized to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and hub genes between DEGs were identified. We also used the miRWalk database to identify regulatory miRNAs associated with expressions of DEGs.
We identified 182 DEGs (160 upregulated and 22 downregulated) between Hashimoto's disease patients and the healthy control group. GO analysis showed that DEGs were mostly concentrated in detection of chemical stimulus involved in sensory perception, intermediate filament cytoskeleton, and olfactory receptor activity. KEGG pathway analysis showed that DEGs were mainly related to olfactory transduction. Some members of the KRTAP family and HTR5A, KNG1, DRD3, HTR1D, TAS2R16, INSL5, TAS2R42, and GRM7 are the most important hub genes in the PPI network. In addition, we recognized that OTUD4, LLPH, and ECHDC1 were the most important hub genes in the miRNA-target gene network.

In HT, there occurs formation of antibodies against the self (thyroid), which causes enlargement of the thyroid gland as a whole and decreased thyroid hormone levels. Most of the patients with HT are given medical line of management (hypo/hyperthyroidism). The indications for surgical line of management for HT are due to pressure symptoms over the trachea and oesophagus, pain in the thyroid gland and for chance of malignancy. Surgical treatment gives complete relief from pain and pressure symptoms and also prevents the risk of malignancy. To evaluate the outcome and complications of total thyroidectomy in painful (symptomatic) Hashimoto's thyroiditis. It was a Hospital based Descriptive study conducted in tertiary care teaching hospital by ENT Department, Sri Manakula Vinayagar Medical College and Hospital, Pondicherry from Nov 2017 to May 2019. Sample size was 30. All patients with symptomatic (painful) HT was given trail of medical therapy (steroids and NSAIDS), following repeated attempts of failed medical therapy, surgical management (total thyroidectomy) was preferred. Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to assess the pain grading pre and post operatively. MS Excel and SPSS trial version 20 software was used to analyze the data. The Wilcoxan Signed Ranked test was used as test of significance to identify the difference between ordinal variables. In this study, all the 30 patients had pain as the predominant symptom. Visual Analog Scale was used to grade the pain in all the patients preoperatively and 2 weeks postoperatively. All the patients had significant reduction in the pain following total thyroidectomy, when compared to pre-operative VAS grading. Total thyroidectomy is the technique of choice in surgical treatment of symptomatic Hashimoto's thyroiditis (pain, tenderness and pressure symptoms) which warrants a radical and definitive control of the disease, without any risk of relapse and without the side effects of medical management. Moreover in longstanding cases of HT, the risk of malignant transformation is prevented due to total thyroidectomy. In experienced hands it assures total relief of compressive and painful symptoms and low incidence of/nil major complications."

This study aimed to investigate a potential mRNA gene that affects the development of PTC, which helps PTC concurrent with HT patients have a better prognosis.
PTC data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. And the validation data of tissue specimens were collected from Guangzhou First People's Hospital. The thyroid tissue sections were hybridized with deleted in malignant brain tumor 1 (DMBT1) probes by situ hybridization. Survival rates were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves, and the log-rank test was used to compare group survival rates. Prognosis clinicopathological factors were analyzed by Cox regression. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Gene and Genomic Encyclopedia (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were performed using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Finally, the correlation of deletion in DMBT1 expression with overall immune status, tumor purity, and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene expression profile was analyzed.
HT was significantly associated with sex, tumor foci, extrathyroidal extension (ETE), residual tumor, and tumor stage (T stage). Moreover, PTC concurrent with HT had a lower risk of recurrence versus non-HT groups. A total of 136 differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs) were identified between HT and non-HT groups. Among them, the expression level of DMBT1 in HT groups was statistically higher than that in non-HT groups. A significant association with ETE and recurrence was revealed in the high expression and the low expression of DMBT1. Furthermore, DMBT1 was an independent predictor of survival. The overall immune activity of high expression of DMBT1 was higher than that of the low-expression group.
The PTC patients with HT had better behavior features and prognosis than those with simple PTC. DMBT1 in PTC-HT patients was a potential possible factor that inhibits tumors. High expression of DMBT1 may improve PTC prognosis by immune-related pathways."

We aimed to estimate serum IFN- γ level and its expression profile in Egyptian women with HT and assess their possible association with UEI. In this study, we examined 120 women with HT. We evaluated fertility in all patients; female patients who suffer from UEI were detected. Diagnosis of HT was based on the clinical data and the laboratory measures, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to measure serum IFN- γ, and the expression of IFN-γ messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) was assayed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). According to the results of this study, 37.5 % of the studied females who suffered from HT were diagnosed with UEI. The serum level of IFN-γ and its gene expression showed a significant positive correlation with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroid autoantibodies. However, a negative correlation was found with anti-müllerian hormone (AMH), free T4 (FT3), and free T4 (FT4). Analysis by linear regression revealed that TSH and FT3 were associated with serum level of IFN-γ; while FT3 was associated with IFN-γ gene expression. We concluded that both are valued markers in diagnosing UEI in female patients suffering from HT."

The primary outcome was the association of HT with PTC-related mortality, assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression models. The secondary outcome was the association of HT with aggressive characteristics and structural recurrence of PTC, assessed using logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression with and without adjustment for related factors.
Of 9210 patients with PTC (mean [SD] age, 43.6 [12.0] years; 6872 [75%] women) included in the analysis, 1751 (19%) had HT. In the logistic regression model, HT was negatively associated with frequencies of primary tumor size of 4 cm or greater (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.20; 95% CI, 0.12-0.33; P < .001), gross extrathyroidal extension (aOR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.36-0.54; P < .001), extranodal extension (aOR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.55-0.80; P < .001), and distant metastasis (aOR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.04-0.71; P = .02). After a median follow-up of 85 months (range, 12-144 months), 131 PTC-related deaths were identified in the cohort; 2 patients who died had HT. Patients with HT had significantly superior outcomes compared with patients without HT in terms of unadjusted 10-year disease-specific survival (99.9% vs 96.6%; log-rank P < .001) and recurrence-free survival (92.0% vs 87.6%; log-rank P = .001). After adjusting for sex, age, primary tumor size, extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis, extent of surgery, and radioactive iodine ablation, HT was associated with decreased PTC-related mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.76; P = .02). Stratified analysis showed that HT was associated with less frequent structural recurrence in patients with extrathyroidal extension (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.38-0.71; P < .001; P = .002 for interaction) or after total thyroidectomy (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.35-0.69; P < .001; P = .009 for interaction).

The present study was aimed to simultaneously evaluate serum levels of sRAGE, AGEs, and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) and investigate the relationships between these oxidative stress markers and clinical and biochemical parameters of thyroid function in euthyroid children with HT.
This is a case-control study carried out in a single university hospital center.
We enrolled 19 newly diagnosed euthyroid HT pediatric patients (3 M, 16 F; median age 12.44 years, range 6.54-15.81 years) and 16 age-, sex-, and BMI-matched healthy controls (5 M, 11 F; median age 12.83 years, range 5.68-15.07 years). None was on levothyroxine treatment. The exclusion criteria were autoimmune, inflammatory, and infection comorbidities. Patients did not differ significantly from controls with regard to lipid or for anthropometric parameters.
sRAGE levels were significantly lower in HT patients (median 414.30 pg/mL, range 307.30-850.30 pg/mL) than in controls (561.30, 273.20-1121.60 pg/mL; p = 0.034). No differences emerged between patients and controls with regard to serum AGEs (124.25 AU/g prot, 71.98-186.72 vs. 133.90, 94.06-200.78 AU/g prot, p = 0.707) and AOPPs (1.13 nmol/mL, 0.62-1.83 vs. 1.17, 0.76-1.42 nmol/mL, p = 0.545).
sRAGE levels were decreased in euthyroid children/adolescents at the onset of HT, suggesting that autoimmunity per se seems to play an important role in such a reduction of sRAGE, irrespective of any functional alteration. Children and adolescents suffering from HT may exhibit increased susceptibility to oxidative damage, even when in euthyroid status."

The aim of this study was to investigate the potential role of Hashimoto thyroiditis (HT) in predicting 1-year and 5-year treatment response after RAIT and prognosis.
We retrospectively included 314 consecutive patients (174 low-risk and 140 intermediate-risk) who received thyroidectomy plus RAIT. One-year and 5-year disease status was evaluated according to 2015 ATA categories response based upon biochemical and structural findings.
HT was reported histopathologically in 120 patients (38%). DTC patients with concomitant HT received a higher number of RAITs and cumulative RAI activities. Initial RAIT reached an excellent response in 63% after one year and 84% after 5 years. The rate of excellent response one year and 5-year after first RAIT was significantly lower in HT groups, compared to not HT (p < 0.001). Instead, HT did not have a prognostic role considering PFS and OS; while stimulate thyroglobulin (sTg) at ablation was significantly related to survival.
HT may affect the efficacy of RAIT in low to intermediate risk DTC, particularly reducing the successful rate of excellent response after RAIT. Instead, HT did not have a prognostic impact such as stimulated sTg."

Hypothyroidism is a rare cause of tamponade that is attributed to the slow accumulation of effusive fluid into the intrapericardial space. In individuals living with HIV/AIDS, tamponade is commonly associated with infection or malignancy. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a patient with HIV/AIDS to have been identified with tamponade secondary to hypothyroidism. CASE REPORT Herein, we describe the case of a 52-year-old male patient with a history of AIDS, who presented with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and episodic gastrointestinal discomfort for the past several weeks, in conjunction with progressive fatigue. At initial presentation, he had no hemodynamic or clinical signs of tamponade, but pericardial effusion was incidentally found on imaging. Further investigations revealed an undiagnosed Hashimoto's thyroiditis as a function of restored immunocompetency, which ultimately led to the impending tamponade in this patient. We describe his clinical course through diagnosis of autoimmune hypothyroidism, review cardiac tamponade and hypothyroidism in the context of people living with HIV/AIDS, and discuss this rare manifestation of restored immunocompetency. CONCLUSIONS Hypothyroidism should be ruled out in all patients presenting with pericardial effusions or cardiac tamponade, even in people living with HIV/AIDS or those with a history of immune deficiencies."

Several hypotheses have been postulated to explain these persisting symptoms. We hypothesized that thyroid autoimmunity may play a role.
A systematic literature review.
A PubMed search was performed to find studies investigating the relation between the presence of thyroid autoimmunity and (persisting) symptoms. Included studies were critically appraised by the Newcastle - Ottawa Scale (NOS) and then subdivided into (A) disease-based studies, comparing biochemically euthyroid patients with HD, and euthyroid patients with non-autoimmune hypothyroidism or euthyroid benign goitre, and (B) (general) population-based studies. Due to different outcome measures among all studies, meta-analysis of data could not be performed.
Thirty out of 1259 articles found in the PubMed search were included in this systematic review. Five out of seven disease-based studies found an association between thyroid autoimmunity and symptoms or lower quality of life (QoL). Sixteen of 23 population-based studies found a comparable positive association. In total, the majority of included studies reported an association between thyroid autoimmunity and persisting symptoms or lower QoL in biochemically euthyroid patients.
(Thyroid) autoimmunity seems to be associated with persisting symptoms or lower QoL in biochemically euthyroid HD patients. As outcome measures differed among the included studies, we propose the use of similar outcome measures in future studies. To prove causality, a necessary next step is to design and conduct intervention studies, for example immunomodulation vs. placebo preferably in the form of a randomized controlled trial, with symptoms and QoL as main outcomes."

Two thousand nine hundred twenty-six patients who underwent thyroidectomy and lymph node dissection between January 2015 and December 2018 were enrolled in this study. Patient demographics and clinicopathologic features were analyzed.
Of the total enrolled patients, 598 (20.4%) had concurrent HT. There were 1482 PTC cases with N0, 1033 cases with N1a, and 411 cases with N1b. Patients with HT had lower frequency of extrathyroidal extension (ETE), lymphatic vascular (LV) invasion, high pathological T stage (III+IV) and central LNM rate. Stratifying central LNM by non-ETE or without intrathyroidal spreading, it was further found that central LNM rate in patients with HT was lower than that of patients without HT. However, there was no significant difference in the central LNM rate in patients with PTC stratified by ETE or intrathyroidal spreading. HT with PTC played a weak protective role in N1a, reducing the risk of N1a by 16.4%. Conversely, HT is a risk factor for N1b, increasing the risk by 1.336 times compared to patients without HT. TgAb is an independent risk factor for N1b, which appears related to the promotion of N1b by HT.
In PTC, HT has a protective effect on central LNM and a risk effect on lateral LNM, although the difference was not significant. This weak protective effect on N1a is more obvious in PTC with less aggressive clinicopathologic characteristics. The risk effect of HT on N1b may be associated with TgAb."

Cross sectional study included 160 hypothyroid subjects, 112 patients with HT and 48 hypothyroid non-HT controls. They were diagnosed based on anti-TPO Ab and or anti-TG Ab results. All cases were subjected to full history taking, thyroid ultrasound examination and a panel of assays (TSH, f.T3, f.T4, anti-TPO Ab, anti-TG Ab, calcium, alkaline phosphatase and phosphate). Serum 25-OH-vitamin D3 was assayed using HPLC-UV method. VDR variants (FokI and BsmI) were genotyped using real-time PCR.
FokI AA genotype was statistically higher in HT patients than control group (P value = 0.02) with subsequently higher serum 25-OH-vitamin D3 level in comparison to all other genotypes (P value = 0.039). Serum 25-OH-vitamin D3 level was statistically indifferent between HT and control group (P value = 0.223). A statistically significant increase in total thyroid volume was observed in HT group (P value = 0.002).
FokI AA genotype is more associated with HT in Egyptian patients compared to hypothyroid non-HT controls. Moreover, patients with FokI AA genotype have statistically higher levels of 25-OH-vitamin D3 suggesting VDR dysfunction even in patients expressing normal level of vitamin D."

A retrospective analysis of consecutive PTC patients who underwent surgery at an academic center between Jan. 2010 and Jan. 2020 was performed. The primary end point was to assess whether a background of HT implied a higher likelihood for postoperatively determined high-risk histopathologic features. Accordingly, its implication on initial surgical planning. Tumor high-risk features included aggressive histologic variants, lymphovascular invasion, extrathyroidal extension, multifocality, and positive nodal metastasis. To achieve the primary outcome of interest, a two group-designation was followed: group A (none-HT-group) and group B (HT-group). The two groups were also compared regarding postoperative complications as a secondary outcome of interest. In the specified period, 331 patients were found to have a histologically proven diagnosis of PTC. Group A accounted for 80% (265/331) of the study cohort, while group B accounted for the remainder 20%. PTC was significantly more prevalent in the absence of HT (p < 0.0001). Both groups were comparable in mean-patient-age. However, Group B demonstrated a considerably higher male:female ratio (1:10 vs. 1:3; p = 0.01). All postoperatively determined high-risk histopathologic features were comparable in both groups (p > 0.05). Nevertheless, transient hypoparathyroidism was considerably higher in group B (12% vs. 23%; p = 0.02). A background of HT does not seem to reflect a more aggressive cancerous biologic behavior. Therefore, it should not preclude the conservative surgical strategy adopted by the most recent clinical practice guidelines."

On the other hand, inflammation-related atypia and cancerogenesis is also widely studied. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed 91 specimens of thyroid gland surgical resections with FED during a 10-year-period at the university hospital pathology department. The study population consisted of 68 females and 15 males aged between 22 and 86 years. The preoperative cytology diagnoses had mainly been in the indeterminate categories with prevailing AUS/FLUS results in the FED-only group (p = 0.005) and suspicious for malignancy and malignant in the group with FED plus adjacent malignancy. The decision for surgery was malignancy related in 48.2% of the cases. The lesions were sized 0.1-3.5 mm and multifocal in 45.1% of the cases. Immunohistochemically, the atypical cells were cyclin D1-positive in 67.5%, galectin-3 in 72.7%, CK19 in 85.7%, and HBME-1 in 87.0% of cases. In conclusion, FED is suggested to be a pathogenetic link between inflammation-related atypia and papillary carcinoma and thus a premalignant precursor of papillary carcinoma in HT as 36.1% of the specimens contained also papillary carcinoma in the present study. Both histopathological nuclear features and the immunoprofile of FED are widely shared with that of papillary carcinoma."

Moreover, OS has been shown to inhibit Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), which is able to prevent hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α stabilization. The aims of this study were to determine the involvement of NADPH-oxidases (NOX), SIRT1, and HIF-1α in HT pathophysiology as well as the status of antioxidant proteins such as peroxiredoxin 1 (PRDX1), catalase, and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). The protein expressions of NOX2, NOX4, antioxidant enzymes, SIRT1, and HIF-1α, as well as glucose transporter-1 (GLUT-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), were analyzed by Western blot in primary cultures of human thyrocytes that were or were not incubated with Th1 cytokines. The same proteins were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry in thyroid samples from control and HT patients. In human thyrocytes incubated with Th1 cytokines, NOX4 expression was increased whereas antioxidants, such as PRDX1, catalase, and SOD1, were reduced. Th1 cytokines also induced a significant decrease of SIRT1 protein expression associated with an upregulation of HIF-1α, GLUT-1, and VEGF-A proteins. With the exception of PRDX1 and SOD1, similar results were obtained in HT thyroids. OS due to an increase of ROS produced by NOX4 and a loss of antioxidant defenses (PRDX1, catalase, SOD1) correlates to a reduction of SIRT1 and an upregulation of HIF 1α, GLUT-1, and VEGF-A.

At least two measurements of TPO antibody levels taken during pregnancy and one after pregnancy were evaluated for each patient in the study group.
 At the end of pregnancy, the average TPO antibody level for the 20 patients studied was 137 IU/ml (+/-214 IU/ml), the lowest being 16 IU/ml and the highest 1000 IU/ml. Despite iodine prophylaxis, levels of TPO antibodies decreased in 18 patients during pregnancy, falling below the reference value of 35 IU/ml in 5 cases. However, in one patient TPO antibodies increased from 60 IU/ml to 237 IU/ml during pregnancy while in another, levels remained constant at 1000 IU/ml.
 Iodine prophylaxis in pregnant women, taken at a dose of 100 or 150 μg daily was shown to have no negative systemic effects on Hashimoto's thyroiditis in a group of pregnant women with increased TPO levels, and can therefore be recommended for expectant mothers, including those with this disease.

 Die Daten wurden retrospektiv von 20 schwangeren Patienteninnen erhoben, bei denen im Zeitraum vom 01.12.2012 bis zum 01.12.2014 eine Hashimoto-Thyreoiditis diagnostiziert worden war und die eine Jodprophylaxe mit 100 µg (n = 1) oder 150 µg (n = 19) erhalten haben. Für die eingeschlossenen Patientinnen wurden mindestens 2 Werte der TPO-Antikörper in der Schwangerschaft sowie mindestens ein Wert der TPO-Antikörper nach der Schwangerschaft ausgewertet.
 Am Ende der Schwangerschaft lag der durchschnittliche TPO-Antikörper-Wert der 20 Patientinnen bei 137 IU/ml (+/–214 IU/ml), der niedrigste Wert lag bei 16 IU/ml und der höchste Wert bei 1000 IU/ml. Bei 18 Patientinnen waren die Werte der TPO-Antikörper trotz Jodprophylaxe in der Schwangerschaft gesunken, bei 5 Patientinnen unter den Referenzwert von 35 IU/ml. Bei einer Patientin waren die TPO-Antikörper während der Schwangerschaft von 60,3 IU/ml auf 237 IU/ml gestiegen und bei einer Patientin bei 1000 IU/ml konstant geblieben.
 Die übliche Jodprophylaxe bei schwangeren Frauen mit einer Dosierung zwischen 100 und 150 μg täglich zeigte keine systematisch negativen Auswirkungen auf die Hashimoto-Thyreoiditis in einer Gruppe von Schwangeren mit erhöhten TPO-Antikörpern und kann daher auch für werdende Mütter mit dieser Diagnose empfohlen werden."

Due to the higher prevalence of Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (HT) in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) patients, we aimed to evaluate ovarian reserve and the effect of autoimmune exposure time on ovarian reserve in PCOS patients with HT by Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels.
Forty-six PCOS patients and 46 PCOS with HT diagnosed patients who are between 18 and 35 years old were recruited for this study. Detailed medical histories were obtained from all participants. Polycystic ovary image was evaluated and antral follicles were counted by transvaginal ultrasound. Modified Ferriman Gallwey score, body mass index, waist/hip ratio of the patients were examined. Hormonal, biochemical profiles and AMH levels of the patients were evaluated during the early follicular phase. The data of both groups were statistically analyzed with SPSS 18.0.
20 (43.5%) patients in the PCOS group were fertile, 8 (17.4%) patients in the PCOS + HT group were fertile, fertility rate was significantly lower in PCOS + HT group. The mean AMH value was 8.8 ± 8.8 in the PCOS + HT group and 12.4 ± 8.1 in the PCOS group and it was significantly lower in the PCOS + HT group (p = 0.043). AMH values were significantly negatively correlated with anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody (anti-TPO) level and the duration of HT. There was a significant positive correlation between the anti-TPO level and the duration of HT. CONCLUSıON: We pointed out that the coexistence of PCOS and HT, two prevalent diseases of reproductive age, further diminished ovarian reserve. More exposure of the ovaries to autoantibodies can cause ovarian destruction, similar to the thyroid gland like HT. Because of all these close relations with PCOS and thyroid dysfunctions, we recommend evaluating both thyroid autoantibodies and hormone levels in PCOS patients at the first visit. Patients with PCOS + HT should be monitored more closely to determine the fertility treatment options and control premature ovarian failure (POF) table."

A higher prevalence of HT in women with PCOS, relative to healthy individuals, is observed consistently. Combined occurrence of both diseases is associated with a higher risk of severe metabolic and reproductive complications. Genetic factors strongly impact the pathogenesis of both PCOS and HT and several susceptibility loci associated with a higher risk of both disorders have been identified. Furthermore, some candidate gene polymorphisms are thought to be functionally relevant; however, few genetic variants are proposed to be causally associated with the incidence of both disorders together."

Patients with Hashimoto thyroiditis report symptom distress more often than those with non-autoimmune thyroid disorders. Therefore, anti-thyroid antibodies may be related to decreased quality of life in persons with Hashimoto thyroiditis. The etiology of lingering symptoms, even in euthyroidism, remains unknown. The relationship between anti-thyroid antibodies and quality of life for people with Hashimoto thyroiditis has not been evaluated in a systematic review.
The participants were males and females at least 12 years of age, in any country, with Hashimoto thyroiditis. Participants not in a euthyroid state were excluded from this review. In this review, the exposure was the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies and the primary outcome was quality of life as measured by a validated scale.
A three-step search strategy was implemented with an initial search of PubMed and CINAHL. A comprehensive database search using all identified keywords and index terms was undertaken in March 2019 for relevant published literature, gray literature, and clinical trial registries. The final updates to the search strategies were conducted in December 2019. The search was limited to studies published in English after 1956. Two independent reviewers completed screening for inclusion and utilized the recommended JBI approach to critical appraisal, study selection, data extraction, and data synthesis. The findings are presented in a meta-analysis and in a narrative synthesis, which includes tables and figures.
All 13 studies had high methodological quality. Four studies found a significant correlation (P < 0.05) between the presence of anti-thyroid antibodies and quality of life. A fifth study found a significant correlation (P < 0.001) between higher antibody levels and quality of life. A meta-analysis was conducted using two cross-sectional studies, which revealed that the summative small effect size was statistically significant and suggested a lower quality of life in antibody-positive patients. Due to the heterogeneity of the studies, a narrative synthesis was conducted for the three secondary outcomes: symptom distress, executive function, and mental health. Three studies found a statistically significant (P < 0.05) correlation between symptom distress and antibodies, two studies found a statistically significant (P < 0.05) association between executive function and antibodies, and all but one study found a statistically significant (P < 0.05) relationship between mental health and antibodies.
The findings in this review did not reveal a definitive relationship between antibodies and quality of life. However, our meta-analysis suggested a link between anti-thyroid antibodies and decreased quality of life in euthyroid children and adults. Though not conclusive, poor mental health and symptom distress may be associated with anti-thyroid antibodies. Therefore, it may be beneficial to periodically evaluate the quality of life and mental health in euthyroid patients with positive antibodies. It is unlikely that antibodies and executive functions are related. The studies and our review's limitations require replication of findings to confirm a connection between antibodies, quality of life, and the secondary outcomes. Future research should continue to evaluate the relationship between anti-thyroid antibodies and the quality of life in individuals with euthyroid Hashimoto thyroiditis.

We investigated 3 groups of patients (group I - HT, group II - HT+At, group III - At). All laboratory tests for thyroid function and lipid profile detection were used according to international guideline recommendations, coronary and femoral arteries intima-media thickness (IMT) were tested by high-resolution ultrasonography, thyroid gland histology and immunohistochemistry carried out by p63 and S100 protein expression control. The statistical analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel 7.0, SPSS-20 version, Mann-Whitney U-test and Pearson's correlation. Comparisons between groups and factors were made using Multiple Linear Regression model. With the results obtained, dyslipidemia and the diastolic hypertension accelerate the hypothyroidism in HT+At group to predispose carotid and femoral arteries IMT. TSH and anti-TPO antibody levels are directly linked to the cardiovascular complications. Biomarkers S100 and p63 data show negative feedback effects of hypercholesterolemia on the high morphological risk features in Hashimoto parenchyma, which may partially explain the significant trend and pathobiological link of HT with Papillary thyroid carcinoma."

Recent studies of Se supplementation on the effect of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) have been reported, but the exact benefit is unclear as well as the underlying immunologic mechanism. We aimed to evaluate the clinical effect of Se supplement in patients with HT, and explore the potential mechanism against thyroid autoimmunity. A prospective, randomized-controlled study was performed in patients with HT assigned to two groups. Se-treated group (n = 43) received selenious yeast tablet (SYT) for 6 months, whereas no treatment in control group (n = 47). The primary outcome is the change of thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) or thyroglobulin antibody (TGAb). Second, thyroid function, urinary iodine, Se, Glutathione peroxidase3 (GPx3), and Selenoprotein P1 (SePP1) levels were measured during the SYT treatment. Meanwhile, regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their subsets activated Tregs (aTregs), resting Tregs, and secreting Tregs, as well as Helios and PD-1 expression on these cells were also detected. The results showed that SYT treatment significantly decreased TPOAb, TGAb, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, accompanied with the increased Se, GPx3, and SePP1, compared with the control group. Subgroup analysis revealed that subclinical HT may benefit more from this treatment in the decrease of TSH levels by interaction test. Moreover, the percentage of aTregs, Helios/Tregs, and Helios/aTregs were significantly higher in the Se-treated group than control. In conclusion, Se supplementation may have a beneficial effect on thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid function by increasing the antioxidant activity and upregulating the activated Treg cells."

Based on the water iodine concentration, low and moderate degrees of iodine endemia in the location of the patients were determined. In the groups of men and women using water from different water supply sources, there were direct correlations between the water iodine concentrations and the TgAbs and TPOAb titers as well as an inverse dependence between iodine and TSH levels. Multivariate regressive analysis indicated that TgAb and TSH in the group of women using water from a supply network and TPOAb titers in the group of women using well water were independent factors associated with water iodine concentrations. Statistically significant correlations and regressive dependencies between the water iodine concentrations and the biomarkers of the thyroid status of the patients indicate the risk of Hashimoto's thyroiditis progression, especially among women with additional iodine intake."

It makes thyroid surgery more complicated and difficult because there may be adhesions between the thyroid gland and surrounding structures. However, it is still controversial whether HT patients carry a high risk for postoperative complications of thyroid surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate the significance of HT for the postoperative complications of thyroid surgery.
A search for studies assessing the postoperative complication risks of HT patients compared with that of patients with benign nodules (BNs) was performed in PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science. Nine studies (20,118 cases, 1,582 cases of HT and 18,536 cases of BN) were identified, and the data from the relevant outcomes were extracted and analysed.
There were no significant differences between the HT group and BN group in recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (RLNP) and permanent hypoparathyroidism (PHP). The rate of transient hypocalcaemia (THC) was significantly higher in the HT group (16.85%) than in the BN group (13.20%).
The meta-analysis showed that HT only increased the risk of the postoperative complication THC compared to BN. Understanding the significance of HT in postoperative hypoparathyroidism after thyroid surgery would help clinicians perform sufficient preoperative (and postoperative) assessments and to optimise surgical planning."

However, clinical experience treating patients with HT suggests that neuromuscular symptoms may develop in these patients despite long-standing euthyroidism.
In 24 euthyroid patients with HT and 25 healthy controls, physical fatigability was assessed using the arm movement test (AMT) and 6-min walk test (6MWT). Fatigability was based on calculation of linear trend (LT) reflecting dynamic performance within subsequent constant time intervals. Perception of physical fatigue and muscle pain was analyzed using fatigue (FSMC) and pain questionnaires. Obtained results were correlated with clinical, neurophysiological and lab findings.
HT patients showed a negative LT in 6MWT significantly differing from stable performance in controls. LT in AMT did not differ between HT and controls. FSMC scores and pain perception revealed significantly higher levels in HT patients than in controls. Physical FSMC score was primarily influenced by pain perception (standardized regression coefficient, beta = 0.633, p = 0.002). Neither pain score nor physical fatigue score showed a correlation with LT in 6MWT nor did mood, or anti-TPO antibody titer.
A significant physical fatigability could be shown in euthyroid HT patients despite missing obvious neuromuscular deficits in routine testing. Further, elevated pain and fatigue perception in HT patients seem to contribute to nonspecific muscle complaints in these patients. A possible pathogenic role of thyroid autoimmunity in hidden neuromuscular involvement may be suggested."

Sixty HT patients with 64 thyroid nodules (31 PTL and 33 NHT) who had undergone CEUS examination were included in this study. With histopathological results as the reference, we evaluated the imaging features of each nodule on both conventional ultrasonography (US) and CEUS. Quantitative CEUS parameters including peak intensity (PI), time to peak (TTP), and area under the time-intensity curve (AUC) were gathered in the nodule and background parenchyma. The ratio indexes of theses parameters were calculated by the ratio of the lesion and the corresponding thyroid parenchyma. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analyses of valuable US indicators were further preformed to evaluate the diagnostic capability of CEUS in discrimination of PTL and NHT.
Among all the observed US imaging features and CEUS parameters, 10 indicators showed significant differences between PTL and NHT (all P < 0.05). All the significant indicators were ranked according to the odds ratios (ORs). Eight of them were CEUS associated including imaging features of enhancement pattern, degree, homogeneity, and quantification parameters of PI, AUC, ratios of PI, AUC, and TTP, while indicators on conventional US, including vascularity and size ranked the last two with ORs less than 3. The five single CEUS parameters showed good diagnostic performance in diagnosis of PTL with areas under ROC curves of 0.72-0.83 and accuracies of 70.3-75.0%. The combination of CEUS imaging features and the ratios of PI, AUC, and TTP demonstrated excellent diagnostic efficiency and achieved area under ROC curve of 0.92, which was significantly higher than any of the five single parameters (all P < 0.05), with a sensitivity of 83.9%, specificity of 87.9%, and accuracy of 85.9%.
CEUS is an efficient diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis of PTL and NHT for patients with diffuse HT. Conjoint analysis of CEUS imaging features and quantification parameters could improve the diagnostic values."

422,33465800,2021-01-20,Role of the Specialized Pro-resolving Mediator Resolvin D1 in Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.,N/A,"Resolvins are produced by the catabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and play vital roles in inflammation resolution. Resolvins have been associated with autoimmune disorders. This study aimed to measure the level of Resolvin D1 (RVD1) in the serum of Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) patients and healthy controls (HCs) and to further analyse its correlation with thyroid autoantibodies and inflammatory factors.
Sixty-three participants were recruited, namely, 30 untreated HT patients and 33 sex- and age-matched HCs. Serum RVD1 and inflammatory chemokine (MCP-1 and IP-10) levels were measured by ELISA according to the manufacturer's protocol. Serum total T3 (TT3), TT4, free T3 (FT3), FT4, thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were measured using an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Thyroid homeostasis parameters, including the thyroid secretory capacity (SPINA-GT), the total deiodinase activity (SPINA-GD), Jostel's TSH index (TSHI) and the thyrotroph thyroid hormone sensitivity index (TTSI), were calculated.
Serum RVD1 levels in HT patients (134.76, 85.35-201.36 pg/mL) were significantly lower than those in HCs (187.64, 131.01-326.85 pg/mL) (P=0.004). As the TPOAb level increased, the RVD1 level showed a decreasing trend (P for trend=0.002). Both multinomial and ordinal logistics analyses revealed that serum RVD1 levels were negatively correlated with TPOAb levels in the adjusted models. Moreover, RVD1 showed a negative correlation with the inflammatory chemokine IP-1 0 (r=-0.276, P=0.034), TSHI (r=-0.269, P=0.036) and TTSI (r=-0.277, P=0.031).
Thyroid autoimmunity may be associated with low levels of RVD1. Decreased RVD1 levels indicate impaired resolution of inflammation in HT patients."

There is still a significant controversy on whether to perform prophylactic central compartment lymph node dissection for T1/T2 cN0 PTC. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the characteristics and risk factors of central compartment lymph node metastasis in cN0 PTC (T1 or T2 stage) coexists with HT.
From Jun. 2015 to Apr. 2019, the clinicopathological data of 354 patients with stage T1/T2 cN0 PTC admitted to the thyroid tumor surgery of Inner Mongolia People's Hospital were analyzed retrospectively. All patients underwent central compartment lymph node dissection. According to the results of the postoperative pathological examination, the patients were divided into two groups: PTC group (n=236) and PTC coexistent with the HT group (n=118).
The proportion of PTC patients with HT was 33.33% (118/354) in T1/T2 cN0 PTC patients; most of them were women. The levels of serum thyrotropin, antithyroglobulin antibody, and thyroid peroxidase antibody in PTC coexistent with HT group are higher than those in the PTC group (P<0.05). The number of lymphadenectomies in PTC coexistent with HT group was more than that in PTC alone group (P<0.05). Univariate analysis showed that antithyroglobulin antibody positive, tumor diameter >1 cm, and multifocal cancer in T1/T2 stage cN0 PTC coexistent with HT group were all correlated with lymph node metastasis in the central region (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that tumor diameter >1 cm, and multifocal cancer were the risk factors of central compartment lymph node metastasis in patients with T1/T2 stage cN0 PTC coexistent with HT (P<0.05).
HT is not a relevant factor of central lymph node metastasis in T1/T2 cN0 PTC; regardless of the presence or absence of HT, tumor diameter >1 cm and multifocal cancer are risk factors for central lymph node metastasis in patients with T1/T2 cN0 PTC. Therefore, preventive lymph node dissection in the central region should be conducted actively during the operation."

We report a 59-year-old female patient with a remote history of hypothyroidism who presented with status epilepticus and complaints of chronic headaches and cognitive impairment. The presence of sharp frontal waves was identified on her EEG. The patient was initially started on anti-epileptics only; however, her headaches and memory loss escalated, further diagnostic workup was pursued, which revealed high anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies with normal thyroid function tests. The only cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) abnormality noticed was an elevated protein concentration. MRI showed non-specific right frontal lobe pial enhancement. Remaining infectious, rheumatologic, and neurologic testing was unremarkable. The patient was started on a steroid regimen with successful resolution of symptoms and return of cognitive baseline. Hashimoto's encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion; however, it should be considered in patients with high titers of anti-thyroid antibodies and neurological symptoms that cannot be explained by thorough infectious, metabolic, and autoimmune testing. It is essential to recognize this neurological entity as fast clinical improvement may be achieved with steroids and other immunotherapies."

First, we compared the change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) between the hypothyroid condition (before levothyroxine sodium hydrate [LT4] treatment) and euthyroid condition (after LT4 treatment when patients had achieved euthyroidism for at least six months) in patients with T2DM and HT. Next, we compared the change in HbA1c levels before and six months of DPP4i treatment in patients with T2DM with and without HT. In hypothyroid condition the change in HbA1c after six months of DPP4i treatment was 0.13% ± 0.86%. The change in HbA1c levels from when patients first achieved euthyroidism to after six months in the euthyroid condition was 0.26% ± 0.90%. DPP4i efficacy in patients with T2DM and HT was reduced compared to patients with T2DM but without HT (-0.40 ± 0.90 vs. -0.99 ± 0.5, p = 0.0032). These data suggest that hypothyroidism does not impact on DPP4i efficacy. However, the effect of DPP4i in patients with T2DM and HT was reduced compared to that in T2DM patients without HT. An estimation of thyroid function before prescribing DPP4i may be useful tool for predicting the efficacy of DPP4i, allowing the ruling out complications from HT."

The frequencies of HLA-DRB1*04:05 and -DRB1*14:03 alleles were significantly higher and those of HLA-DRB1*01:01 and -DRB1*15:02 alleles were lower in GD patients than in controls. The frequencies of HLA-DRB1*08:03 and -DRB1*09:01 alleles were significantly higher and that of the HLA-DRB1*13:02 allele was lower in HT patients than in controls. A blind association analysis with all amino acid positions identified DRß9 and DRß31 for GD and DRß9, DRß13, and DRß21 for HT. The frequency of Glu-9 was significantly higher and that of Cys-9 was lower in GD patients than in controls. The frequencies of Lys-9 and Phe-13 were significantly higher in HT patients than in controls. DRß9 and DRß13 could be critical amino acid positions in the development of GD and HT."

We report the case of a 48-year-old man admitted for acute respiratory distress, with cardiac ultrasound showing compressive pericardial effusion. Percutaneous pericardiocentesis was performed leading to a rapid clinical improvement. Laboratory tests confirmed severe hypothyroidism related to Hashimoto's disease. Despite hormone replacement therapy, pericardial effusion recurred after 3 weeks, requiring surgical drainage. Pericardial histology highlighted slight chronic fibrous pericarditis. The cardiac ultrasound scan performed 4 months later showed a well-tolerated chronic pericardial effusion. In conclusion, hypothyroidism should be suspected in case of cardiac tamponade especially in the absence of tachycardia, or in winter when myxoedema is prone to decompensation. Prognosis is generally good under hormone replacement therapy but ultrasound monitoring should be carried out at least until euthyroidism is achieved."

To estimate the shared genetic influence on overt HT and GD and to examine if the heritability differs between men and women.
We used national health registries to identify cases of HT and GD in a cohort of 110 814 Swedish twins. By comparing intra-class and cross-twin cross-trait correlations in dizygotic and monozygotic twins, we calculated heritability and the proportions thereof shared between the diseases. Univariate estimates of heritability were calculated by sex.
The heritability for HT and GD was 65% (95% CI, 61-70) and 63% (95% CI, 55-72), respectively. The genetic correlation was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.50) and shared genetic effects accounted for 8% of the variance for both HT and GD. Univariate heritability was significantly higher in men than in women for HT (90% vs 60%, P < 0.001) but not for GD (79% vs 63%, P = 0.085).
From a genetic perspective, HT and GD appear to be only modestly related diseases. Hence, the term ""autoimmune thyroid disease,"" used to cluster these disorders, may have limited validity in a genetic context. Moreover, the mechanisms contributing to HT are partly different for the sexes, with genetic components more important in men."

Despite the significant differences in a pathogenesis and a clinical picture between HT and GD, the literature describes the cases of the conversion of one autoimmune disease to another, which, according to one version, is associated with a change in the balance between the levels of a stimulating and blocking antibodies to the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor. At the same time, there are more frequent observations of the transition of GD to HT, and much less often describe, on the contrary, the development of GD against the background of HT. The article presents a clinical case of the conversion of HT to GD. A detailed algorithm of the conservative management according to the «block-replace» scheme is described, indicating the results of laboratory and instrumental examination. At the time of describing the clinical case, the result of the treatment can be considered successful. The predictors such as a low level of the thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor and thyroid volume before discontinuation of the thyrostatic therapy suggest a low risk of the recrudescence of GD.According to the authors, the phenomenon of the conversion of one autoimmune thyroid disease to another, in addition to the scientific interest, is important for the practitioners, since a timely change in the diagnostic paradigm can significantly change the treatment strategy and the favorably affect the prognosis of disease, preventing the development of complications."

This short review to honour his passing focuses on the developments in our understanding of the causes and pathogenesis of HT over the last five years. Recent genetic studies have reported heritability estimates for HT and associated diseases for the first time, and emphasised the complexity of the genetic factors involved, including monogenic forms of HT. Environmental factors continue to be elucidated, especially as a side effect of drugs which modulate the immune system therapeutically. Regarding pathogenetic mechanisms, multiple cytokine networks have been identified which involve the thyroid cells in a circuit of escalating proinflammatory effects, such as the expression of inflammasome components, and an array of different defects in T regulatory cells may underlie the loss of self-tolerance to thyroid autoantigens. Finally, a number of studies have revealed fresh insights into disease associations with HT which may have both pathological and clinical significance, the most intriguing of which is a possible direct role of the autoimmune process itself in causing some of the persistent symptoms reported by a minority of patients with levothyroxine-treated HT."

Study included 115 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue material from the teaching, research and diagnostic laboratory of Tbilisi State Medical University. Study material was divided into following groups: normal thyroid gland (n=15), Non-invasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary-Like Nuclear Features (NIFTP) (n=15), classic papillary carcinoma (CPC)(n=20), follicular variant of papillary carcinoma (FPC) (n=17), cylindric-cell variant of papillary carcinoma (CCPC)(n=9), Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) (n=25) and the co-occurrence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and papillary carcinoma (HTPC) (n=14). Standard immunohistochemistry was used to detect ER, PR, Ki67, CK19, CD56. In addition, lymphocytic infiltration was evaluated in H&E stained specimens. Study results showed that ER and PR expression is higher in FPC, CCPC and HTPC compared to CPC (p<0.001), whilst lymphocytic infiltrate is lower in FPC and CCPC compared to CPC (p<0.05). In addition, ER and PR expression is higher in HTPC compared to HT only (p<0.001). The thyreocyte/lymphocyte proliferation index is increased in FPC and CCPC compared to CPC and it is also higher in HTPC compared to only HT and CPC (p<0.05). The expression of sex steroid hormones plays an important role in the pathogenesis of papillary thyroid carcinoma. The expression level of ER and PR is even higher in cases where Hashimoto's thyroiditis and papillary carcinoma co-occur. Therefore, we can conclude that Hashimoto's thyroiditis may play an important role in the development of papillary thyroid carcinoma."

This study aims to reveal the relationship between shear wave elastography (SWE) and Doppler parameters in patients with HT.
The study group consisted of 45 patients diagnosed with HT, and 20 control patients without thyroid pathology. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and antithyroid peroxidase (TPO) values were examined in patients with HT. Thyroid gland volume and echo patterns were evaluated in the gray-scale US. Doppler measurements –peak systolic velocity (Vmax), end-diastolic velocity (Vmin), pulsatility index (PI), resistivity index (RI)– from the superior thyroidal artery and SWE measurements were taken from both thyroid lobes.

It is sometimes difficult to distinguish HT from mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma using cytology or histology alone. This has necessitated the use of immunohistochemistry and other molecular techniques. A descriptive study was undertaken to determine the prevalence of MALT lymphoma and other associations of HT using histopathological and immunohistochemical methods. For testing of kappa and lambda antibodies, paraffin sections were prepared for immunohistochemical staining using a peroxidase-antiperoxidase immune complex method. Immunostaining in HT, demonstrated a polyclonal lymphoid population, as evidenced by dual positivity for kappa and lambda staining cells, whereas MALT lymphoma revealed a monoclonal lymphoid population, with strong positivity for kappa immunostaining and lack of lambda light chain expression. The proportion of MALT lymphoma in surgically treated cases of HT in the present study was 3.5% (95% CI: 0%-8.3%). The common malignancy associated with HT was papillary carcinoma of the thyroid (8.8%). Among the benign conditions, nodular colloid goiter (7%) was more commonly associated. Although modern molecular techniques are available for the confirmation of lymphomas, they are more expensive, time consuming and are available only in a few centers. Strict morphological criteria can differentiate HT from MALT lymphoma, but in suspicious cases, paraffin section immunohistochemistry using light chain restriction can offer comparable and reliable results. Since papillary carcinoma and MALT lymphoma have been associated with HT, these patients require careful surveillance."

We prospectively included 36 patients with HT (mean age 41.6 ± 13.8 years, range 18-64 years) and 18 age and sex-matched healthy control subjects (mean age 41.6 ± 13.1 years, range 18-63 years). All patients were euthyroid at the time of imaging. Fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) values of 15 distinct neuroanatomical locations were measured and compared.
FA values of the patients with HT were lower in cingulum, globus pallidus (GP), cerebellar white matter (CWM) than the control (P = .019, .002, and <.001, respectively). MD values of the CWM in patients were higher than the control (P = .008). AD values of patients with HT were lower in the cingulum, posterior limbs of the internal capsule, GP, and putamen (P = .038, .038, .030, and .045, respectively). RD values of cingulum and CWM in HT were higher than controls (P <.001 and P = .011, respectively). There was a negative relationship between the FA values of PLIC and a positive relationship between the MD values of the corona radiata and TPOAb levels were detected.

However, the exact role of lncRNAs in Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) has been rarely studied. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of lncRNAs and the potential biomarkers in HT, a total of 33 patients with HT and 32 healthy volunteers were enrolled in the present study, and five patients and five healthy controls were investigated using next generation sequencing. A total of 218 dysregulated lncRNAs, including 94 upregulated and 124 downregulated lncRNAs, were identified and examined in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with HT. The majority of the lncRNAs were intergenic and exonic (66.06%). Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis demonstrated that abnormally expressed lncRNAs were enriched in the 'NF‑kB expression', in the 'TGF‑β signaling pathway' and in the 'JAK‑STAT signaling pathway', which are associated with the immunopathogenic mechanisms of HT. In total, three lncRNAs (LOC729737, XLOC_I2_006631 and BC041964) were validated and had a trend identical to that detected by the sequencing results. The expression of lncRNA‑XLOC_I2_006631 was upregulated and was positively correlated with the serum concentrations of anti‑thyroperoxidase antibody in patients with HT. Methyl‑CpG‑binding protein 2 (MECP2) was identified as the potential regulatory gene of lncRNA‑XLOC_I2_006631 using a prediction program. The expression of MECP2 was increased and was positively correlated with the elevated expression levels of lncRNA‑XLOC_I2_006631 and anti‑thyroperoxidase antibody in patients with HT. Furthermore, lncRNA‑XLOC_I2_006631 was able to regulate MECP2 expression in vitro. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis suggested that lncRNA‑XLOC_I2_006631 has a potential diagnostic value. Collectively, the present results indicated the important role of dysregulated lncRNAs in HT and demonstrated that lncRNA‑XLOC_I2_006631 functioned as a positive regulator of MECP2 expression, suggesting a potential mechanism. Thus, lncRNA‑XLOC_I2_006631 may be used as a biomarker of HT."

In this study we assessed salivary function in women with HT, who had not experienced xerostomia and, for the first time, evaluated the effects of thyroid auto-antibodies on this function.: METHODS:  Sixty consecutive subjects were included, comprising 32 women (mean age, 36 ± 12 years) diagnosed with HT accompanied by differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) in the study group (HT group), along with a control group (DTC group) of 28 women (mean age, 40 ± 12 years) diagnosed with DTC only. Salivary gland scintigraphy was used to assess salivary function with the semi-quantitative parameters of maximum absorption ratio and maximum secretion ratio, the decrease of which indicate impaired salivary function. Moreover, the HT and DTC groups were divided into four subgroups (Anti
 None of the semi-quantitative parameters examined in parotid or submandibular glands differed significantly between the HT and DTC groups. However, the maximum secretion ratio for the parotid and submandibular glands were significantly different in the subgroup comparison (p < 0.05). Furthermore, the TgAb, TPOAb, and TSH values correlated significantly with salivary excretive function (p ≤ 0.05).
 Women with HT without xerostomia may not have salivary functional impairment during hypothyroidism. Serum thyroid autoantibody and TSH levels may mainly influence salivary excretive function but not uptake function.
Die Hashimoto-Thyreoiditis (HT) kann bei Patienten eine Speichelfunktionsstörung verursachen, die zu einer Xerostomie führt. Allerdings ist wenig bekannt über Veränderungen der Speichelfunktion bei Patienten ohne eindeutige Symptome von Mundtrockenheit. In dieser Studie untersuchten wir die Speichelfunktion bei Frauen mit HT ohne Xerostomie und bewerteten zum ersten Mal die Auswirkungen von Schilddrüsen-Autoantikörpern auf diese Funktion.
Sechzig konsekutive Probanden wurden eingeschlossen, darunter 32 Frauen (mittleres Alter: 36 ± 12 Jahre), bei denen in der Studiengruppe (HT-Gruppe) eine HT mit differenziertem Schilddrüsenkarzinom (DTC) diagnostiziert wurde, sowie eine Kontrollgruppe (DTC-Gruppe) von 28 Frauen (mittleres Alter: 40 ± 12 Jahre), bei denen nur DTC diagnostiziert wurde. Die Speicheldrüsen-Szintigrafie wurde zur Beurteilung der Speichelfunktion mit den semi-quantitativen Parametern maximale Absorptionsratio und maximale Sekretionsratio durchgeführt, deren Abnahme auf eine gestörte Speichelfunktion hinweisen.

Epigenetic alterations may provide important insights into genetic-environmental interactions in HT. Here, we examined global DNA methylation patterns in patients with HT during pregnancy. DNA was extracted from 13 women with HT during pregnancy (HTDP) and eight healthy pregnant women as a control group. Genome-wide methylation was detected with the use of an Illumina Human Methylation 850K Beadchip. A total of 652 differentially methylated positions (DMPs) and 27 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were identified between the HTDP and control groups. GO analysis revealed that DMPs were significantly enriched in 540 GO terms, which included regulation of the differentiation of keratinocytes, T helper cell differentiation, and alpha-beta T-cell differentiation. Moreover, significant enrichment of KEGG pathways of the DMPs included mucin-type O-glycan biosynthesis, focal adhesion, and the insulin signaling pathway. The GO items associated with DMRs included muscle cell proliferation, response to biotic stimulus, anatomical structure formation involved in morphogenesis, and genes primarily involved in the FoxO signaling pathway. Finally, the DTNA gene was identified as the seed gene of functional epigenetic modules. In summary, the DNA methylation pattern of the HTDP group was distinct from that of the control group, and thus, changes in DNA methylation may influence the development of HT by regulation of the autoimmunity process."

Moreover, with a deepening understanding, emerging evidence has shown that immune dysfunctions caused by HT conditions, including imbalanced subsets of CD4+ T-helper cells, B regulatory (Breg) cells, high expression levels of CD56dim natural killer (NK) cells, and cytokines, possibly play an important role in impairing maternal tolerance to the fetus. In recent years, unprecedented progress has been made in recognizing the specific changes in immune cells and molecules in patients with HT, which will be helpful in exploring the mechanism of HT-related miscarriage. Based on these findings, research investigating some potentially more effective treatments, such as selenium (Se), vitamin D3, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), has been well developed over the past few years. In this review, we highlight some of the latest advances in the possible immunological pathogenesis of HT-related miscarriage and focus on the efficacies of treatments that have been widely introduced to clinical trials or practice described in the most recent literature."

We aimed to develop and validate a nomogram model for the preoperative assessment of central LN metastasis.
We retrospectively collected the data of 994 PTC patients with HT who underwent surgery at the West China Hospital from January 2008 to December 2017. Among them, 606 patients who underwent surgeries relatively earlier comprised the training cohort for nomogram development, while the other 388 who underwent surgeries relatively later formed the validation cohort to validate the model's performance. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted using the data of the two respective cohorts, as well as the data of the combined cohort. The relevant preoperative potential risk factors include demographic characteristics, medical history information, thyroid function test, ultrasound characteristics and BRAF V600E gene detection. A nomogram model was subsequently developed. The performance, discrimination and calibration of the nomogram model were assessed in the training and validation cohorts and in the combined cohort.
The central LN metastasis rate of PTC with HT was 49.7% (301/606) and 48.7% (193/388) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that younger age, normal body mass index, BRAF V600E mutation, larger maximum diameter, left lobe tumour, aspect ratio >1, capsular invasion and calcification were significant risk factors for central LN metastasis in PTC patients with HT. The preoperative nomogram showed good calibration and discrimination for the training and validation cohorts, as well as for the combined data set.
The nomogram we developed and validated with a comprehensive set of preoperative factors is effective in predicting central LN metastasis in PTC patients with HT."

The present study demonstrated that 3D-STE is useful in the early detection of LV myocardial dysfunction in patients with eHsT. We found that eHsT had a negative effect on LV myocardial dynamics. According to these findings, these myocardial alterations that are present early in the disease process may be considered as a reason to start medical treatment earlier, even at the euthyroid stage to prevent LV myocardial impairment."

Although the exact etiology has not been fully elucidated, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is related to an interaction among genetic elements, environmental factors and epigenetic influences. Cellular and humoral immunity play a key role in the development of the disease; thus, a T and B cells inflammatory infiltration is frequently found. Histopathologic features of the disease include lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, lymphoid follicle formation with germinal centers, and parenchymal atrophy. Moreover, the occurrence of large follicular cells and oxyphilic or Askanazy cells is frequently associated to Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Clinically, Hashimoto's thyroiditis is characterized mainly by systemic manifestations due to the damage of the thyroid gland, developing a primary hypothyroidism. Diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is clinical and based on clinical characteristics, positivity to serum antibodies against thyroid antigens (thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin), and lymphocytic infiltration on cytological examination. The mainstream of treatment is based on the management of the hypothyroidism with a substitution therapy. A relationship between Hashimoto's thyroiditis and a possible malignant transformation has been proposed in several studies and involves immunological/hormonal pathogenic links although specific correlation is still debated and needs to be further investigated with prospective studies."

A healthy control group was also included to work as controls. Thyroidstimulating hormone, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, anti-thyroid peroxidase, complete blood count, and C-reactive protein results were obtained from patient files for both the cases and the controls, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was computed NLR for both the groups. Data was analysed using SPSS 22.
Of the 477 subjects, 377(79%) were cases with a mean age of 45.3±13.8 years, and 100(21%) were controls with a mean age of 36.6±10.7 (p<0.001). Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was statistically higher in the cases compared to the controls (p< 0,05). Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio had a negative correlation with thyroid-stimulating hormone, free thyroxine and anti thyroid peroxidise but it was nonsignificant (p>0.05).
Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was found to be an effective low-cost marker in the diagnosis and follow-up of Hashimato's thyroiditis."

Modern approaches to understanding the co-occurrence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and thyroid cancer have consistently found increased prevalence of both conditions, separately as well as of their coexistence. The inflammatory process in Hashimoto's thyroiditis is understood as a potential risk factor for thyroid cancer development. This has also provided a better understanding of the limitations in the current diagnostic and follow-up armamentarium for both conditions, resulting in international guidelines from the clinical and scientific societies. Other recent developments call for a paradigm shift in guidelines on thyroid carcinomas when lymphocytic infiltration is present, which potentially should always be considered the case at least in areas of sufficient iodine intake.
The literature of Hashimoto's thyroiditis as a risk factor for thyroid cancer is reviewed over the last year to highlight new developments in the understanding of their association and future clinical implications."

However, it is difficult to diagnose a subject as Basedow's disease with associated features of Hashimoto's thyroiditis only with elevation of such autoimmune antibodies.
A 44-year-old woman with 5-year history of Basedow's disease underwent a total thyroidectomy. She did not have a goiter. TRAb, TSAb, TPOAg and TgAb were all positive before a total thyroidectomy. In histopathological macroscopic examination, diffuse hyperplasia of the thyroid gland was observed. Furthermore, in histopathological microscopic examination, both characteristics of Basedow's disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis were observed. After a total thyroidectomy, titers of all thyroid-associated autoimmune antibodies were markedly reduced.
Herein, we report a subject with Basedow's disease without a goiter whose TPOAb and TgAb were relatively high at the onset of Basedow's disease. In addition, interestingly, the histopathological findings of this subject showed direct signs of Basedow's disease and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in the same thyroid gland. Considering from such findings, she seemed to have Basedow's disease with associated features of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

In the present nation-wide study we describe familial risk for Graves disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis identified from the Swedish Hospital Discharge Register (years 1964 through 2012) and the Outpatient Register (2001 through 2012). Family relationships were obtained from the Multigeneration Register and cancers from the Cancer Registry. Familial standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for 29,005 offspring with Graves disease and for 25,607 offspring with Hashimoto thyroiditis depending on any of 43 AIDs in parents or siblings. The concordant familial risks for Graves disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis were 3.85 and 4.75, higher for men than for women. The familial risks were very high (11.35, Graves and 22.06, Hashimoto) when both a parent and a sibling were affected. Spousal familial risks were higher for Hashimoto thyroiditis (1.98/1.93) than for Graves disease (1.48/1.50). For Graves disease, 24 discordant AIDs showed a significant association; for Hashimoto thyroiditis, 20 discordant associations were significant. All significant discordant associations were positive for the two thyroid AIDs, with the exception of Hashimoto thyroiditis with Reiter disease. Overall 8 associations were significant only for Graves disease and 6 Hashimoto thyroiditis. The overall high concordant familial risks for Graves disease and Hashimoto thyroiditis suggest a strong genetic contribution to the familial risk.

Moreover, autoimmune disease is an under-recognized cause of several types of tubular dysfunction such as renal tubular acidosis (RTA), Gitelman's syndrome (GS), and Bartter's syndrome (BS). However, the potential mechanism of acquired BS and RTA associated with autoimmune diseases remains unclear. A 55-year-old female patient presented with numbness in both lower extremities for 6 months. She had a 2-year history of HT. Laboratory findings showed hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, and elevated plasma aldosterone concentration and renin activity. Urinary analysis revealed renal wasting of potassium, sodium, and chloride. Therefore, she was diagnosed as having HT and secondary BS and was treated with oral methylprednisolone, potassium chloride, and spironolactone. Two weeks later, her serum potassium levels restored to normal. After that, however, the patient was lost to follow-up. Two years later, she was re-hospitalized for progressive muscle weakness and quadriplegia. Laboratory results demonstrated severe hypokalemia, hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis, and inappropriate alkaline urine. Thus, distal RTA (dRTA) was confirmed, and she was prescribed potassium citrate and prednisone, resulting in the correction of hypokalemia and acid-base disturbance within 2 weeks after discharge. We report an HT patient who initially developed hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis and then developed metabolic acidosis within a few years. To our knowledge, this is the first report of two completely opposite acid-base disturbances associated with renal tubular diseases occurring consecutively in the same patient with HT. Our case may provide a valuable clue for exploring the mechanism of renal involvement in autoimmune diseases."

RT-PCR genotyping was used to determine rs14039 and rs4792742 polymorphisms with DNA samples of subjects and appropriate primer and probes. Besides, required biochemical analyses were performed.
It was determined that the frequencies of the rs14039 GG homozygote polymorphic genotype and the G allele were significantly higher in T2DM+HT patients compared to the control (p=0.03 and p=0.01, respectively) and that especially the GG genotype increases the risk of T2DM+HT 3.046-fold (p=0.01, OR=3.046).

The study included two age-, body mass index-, hormone- and thyroid antibody-matched groups of young euthyroid women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis: 19 women with mild-to-moderate hyperprolactinaemia and 19 individuals with prolactin levels within the reference range. All participants were then treated with vitamin D (4000 IU daily) and selenomethionine (200 µg daily). Serum titres of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin (TgAb) antibodies, serum levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, prolactin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, as well as the calculated parameters of thyroid homeostasis, were determined at baseline and 6 months later.
All women completed the study. With the exception of prolactin and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, there were no differences between the study groups in the investigated parameters.

HR-pQCT of the distal radius and tibia, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) of the spine and hip were performed. Bone strength was estimated using a finite element analysis (FEA).
Cross-sectional control study: in the radius, total (mean 14.6 ± 29.3% (SD); p = 0.04) and trabecular bone areas (19.8 ± 37.1%, p = 0.04) were higher, and cortical volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) lower (-2.2 ± 6.5%, p = 0.032) in hypothyroid patients than in controls. All indices of tibia cortical and trabecular vBMD, microarchitecture, and estimated bone strength were similar between groups, as was hip and spine areal BMD (aBMD). Prospective study: in the radius, mean cortical (-0.9 ± 1.8%, p = 0.02) and trabecular (-1.5 ± 4.6%, p = 0.02) vBMD decreased, and cortical porosity increased (18.9 ± 32.7%, p = 0.02). In the tibia, mean total vBMD (-1.1 ± 1.9%, p = 0.01) and cortical vBMD (-0.8 ± 1.4%, p = 0.01) decreased, while cortical porosity (8.2 ± 11.5%, p = 0.002) and trabecular area (0.2 ± 0.6%, p = 0.047) increased. No changes in FEA were detected. Lumbar spine aBMD decreased (-1.3 ± 3.0%, p = 0.04).
Hypothyroidism was associated with an increased trabecular bone area and a lower mineral density of cortical bone in the radius, as assessed by HR-pQCT. Restoration of euthyroidism mainly increased cortical porosity, while estimated bone strength was unaffected."

Patients newly diagnosed as having HT during 2000-2012 were assigned to the case group. Cases and controls were matched for age and comorbidities at a 1:2 ratio using propensity score matching. Incidence was calculated in the unit of 1000 person-year. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression, multivariate Cox, logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed.
Among 3,996 participants, 2,664 constituted the control group and 1,332 constituted the case group. The PCOS risk in patients with HT increased by 2.37 times [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-4.62] compared with the controls. Hypertension (HTN) [adjusted odds ratio (OR): 1.31, 95% CI: 1.03-1.66] and hyperlipidemia (adjusted OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.2-1.9) were more common in HT patients without PCOS than in other patients. The adjusted OR for CAD in patients with HT was 1.51 (95% CI: 1.11-2.06), whereas that in patients with HT and PCOS was 5.92 (95% CI: 1.32-26.53).
In our study, the PCOS risk in patients with HT increased by 2.37 times, which is lower than the increase in HT risk in Asian patients with PCOS (4.56 times). The proportion of CAD increased significantly by 5.92 times in patients with HT and PCOS compared with patients with HT only."

We assessed the impact of HT on the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) in PTC.
Thirty patients with PTC (group 1) and 30 patients with PTC and HT (group 2) were enrolled in this pilot study. The distribution and number of CD8+ lymphocytes, plasma cells (CD138+), regulatory T cells (forkhead box P3 [FOXP3+)], mast cell tryptase (MCT+), and M2 macrophages (CD163+) were evaluated. To test the hypothesis that HT impacts PTC development via signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) activation and M2 macrophage polarization, we investigated STAT6 expression in tumor and stromal cells. We also evaluated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression by lymph node metastasis (LNM) status.
TIME showed significant between-group differences. Group 1 patients demonstrated immune desert or immune-excluded immunophenotypes, while an inflamed phenotype with more CD8+ cells (P&lt;0.001) predominated in group 2. Immune-excluded TIME was associated with the highest LNM rate. In PTC, LNM was associated with more numerous CD163+ cells. Moreover, LNM in group 1 was associated with increased numbers of mast cells peritumorally and FOXP3+ cells intratumorally and peritumorally. Group 2 demonstrated higher STAT6 but not higher VEGF expression in tumor cells. High VEGF expression was associated with LNM regardless of HT status.
Concomitant HT impacted PTC signaling via STAT6 and TIME by increasing the number of CD8+ cells. LNM is associated with increases in CD163+ cells and VEGF expression in PTC, whereas HT affected LNM through different mechanisms."

The goal of our study was to identify food groups, assessed by food frequency questionnaire, that differ in consumption frequency between 491 patients with HT and 433 controls. We also analysed association of food groups with the wealth of HT-related clinical traits and symptoms. We found significantly increased consumption of animal fat (OR 1.55, p < 0.0001) and processed meat (OR 1.16, p = 0.0012) in HT cases, whereas controls consumed significantly more frequently red meat (OR 0.80, p < 0.0001), non-alcoholic beverages (OR 0.82, p < 0.0001), whole grains (OR 0.82, p < 0.0001) and plant oil (OR 0.87, p < 0.0001). We also observed association of plant oil consumption with increased triiodothyronine levels in HT patients (β = 0.07, p < 0.0001), and, association of olive oil consumption with decreased systolic blood pressure (β = - 0.16, p = 0.001) in HT patients on levothyroxine (LT4) therapy. Analysis of food consumption between HT patients with and without LT4 therapy suggest that patients do not tend to modify their diet upon HT diagnosis in our population. Our study may be of relevance to nutritionists, nutritional therapists and clinicians involved in developing dietary recommendations for HT patients."

The genetic predisposition effect of this autoimmune condition is not thoroughly understood. We analyzed the microarray expression profiles of 13 HT, eight PTCs with (w/) coexisting HT, six PTCs without (w/o) coexisting HT, six micro PTCs (mPTCs), and three normal thyroid (TN) samples. Based on a false discovery rate (FDR)-adjusted p-value ≤ 0.05 and a fold change (FC) > 2, four comparison groups were defined, which were HT vs. TN; PTC w/ HT vs. TN; PTC w/o HT vs. TN; and mPTC vs. TN. A Venn diagram displayed 15 different intersecting and non-intersecting differentially expressed gene (DEG) sets, of which a set of 71 DEGs, shared between the two comparison groups HT vs. TN ∩ PTC w/ HT vs. TN, harbored the relatively largest number of genes related to immune and inflammatory functions; oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS); DNA damage and DNA repair; cell cycle; and apoptosis. The majority of the 71 DEGs were upregulated and the most upregulated DEGs included a number of immunoglobulin kappa variable genes, and other immune-related genes, e.g., CD86 molecule (CD86), interleukin 2 receptor gamma (IL2RG), and interferon, alpha-inducible protein 6 (IFI6). Upregulated genes preferentially associated with other gene ontologies (GO) were, e.g., STAT1, MMP9, TOP2A, and BRCA2. Biofunctional analysis revealed pathways related to immunogenic functions. Further data analysis focused on the set of non-intersecting 358 DEGs derived from the comparison group of HT vs. TN, and on the set of 950 DEGs from the intersection of all four comparison groups. In conclusion, this study indicates that, besides immune/inflammation-related genes, also genes associated with oxidative stress, ROS, DNA damage, DNA repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis are comparably more deregulated in a data set shared between HT and PTC w/ HT. These findings are compatible with the conception of a genetic sequence where chronic inflammatory response is accompanied by deregulation of genes and biofunctions associated with oncogenic transformation. The generated data set may serve as a source for identifying candidate genes and biomarkers that are practical for clinical application."

However, little is known regarding the expression of miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) patients. Therefore, 38 HT patients and 36 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study to identify HT-mediated changes in miRNA expression. Over 1,000 dysregulated miRNAs and their biological functions in the HT patients were identified. Among them, miR-125a-5p expression was upregulated and inversely correlated with low levels of MAF, a transcription factor that inhibits Th1 cells activity and the production of IFN-γ. Luciferase assay results demonstrated that MAF is a direct target gene of miR-125a-5p. Moreover, the proportion of circulating Th1 cells and the transcript levels of IFN-γ were increased in the HT patients. MiR-125a-5p expression positively correlated with the proportion of circulating Th1 cells and the serum concentrations of anti-thyroperoxidase antibodies in the HT patients.

The current study aims to quantify the differences between the investigated specimens of HT-associated PTC versus the HT alone, to reduce the subjective experience of an observer, by the use of fractal parameters as well as gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) textural parameters. We have analyzed 250 segmented nuclei per group (nn = 25 per patient and np = 10 patients per group) using the ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA) as well as an in-house written code for the GLCM analysis. The mean values of parameters were calculated for each patient. The results demonstrated that the malignant cells from the HT-associated PTC specimens showed lower chromatin fractal dimension (p = 0.0321) and higher lacunarity (p = 0.0038) compared with the corresponding cells from the HT specimens. Also, there was a statistically significant difference between the investigated specimens, in the contrast, correlation, angular second moment, and homogeneity, of the GLCM corresponding to the visual texture of follicular cell chromatin. The differences in chromatin fractal and GLCM parameters could be integrated with other diagnostic methods for the improved evaluation of distinctive features of the HT-associated PTC versus the HT in cytology and surgical pathology specimens."

It is caused by an increased level of titers of antibody against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (TG). Because of that,in HT patients, changes are observed in the level and metabolism of thyroid hormones, which leads to unspecified physical and psychological symptoms. A high level of antibodies attacking thyroid antigens has been positively correlated with the symptoms. From the etiological point of view, the most important are genetic factors; however, environmental factors are necessary to provoke the immune system to attack until the process is over. Scientists indicate specified stress, toxification, microbiota dysbiosis and under- or over-nutrition, to name only a few. Dietotherapy of Hashimoto's is based on the proper nourishment of the body and regulation of the immune system by an anti-inflammatory diet. Observational and controlled trials have shown frequent nutrition deficiencies in HT patients. In literature, there is evidence for selenium, potassium, iodine, copper, magnesium, zinc, iron, vitamin A, C, D and B. The role of the proper level of protein intake, dietary fibre and unsaturated fatty acids, especially the n-3 family, has been indicated. HT patients should often eliminate lactose because of intolerance and interactions with levothyroxine and gluten because of possible interactions of gliadin with thyroid antigens. The article describes the nutrition factors of HT patients, and share nutrition recommendations for diet therapy."

HT specimens (n = 280) were retrieved from the Department of Pathology, Fimlab Laboratories. After re-evaluation, 82 (29%) cases (72 females and 10 males, 52 ± 17 years) with significant fibrosis were selected. CD38, IgG and IgG4 positivity in plasma cells was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Adjusted IgG4-positive plasma cells per HPF > 20 and IgG4- to IgG-positive plasma cell ratio > 30% were adopted as threshold criteria and related to other morphological features. IgG4-positive HT group included 13 cases (15% from fibrotic HT, 4.6% from all HT, 50 ± 15 years, 11 females) with adjusted HPF count 30 ± 5 (23-40) IgG4-positive cells. IgG4-positivity significantly correlated with the presence of lobulation, oncocytic metaplasia and certain type of fibrosis, fibrosis spread outside the gland, lymphocytes/plasma cells epithelial penetration, the predominance of microfollicles and follicular atrophy in the present study. Despite the persisting uncertainty whether HT is IgG4-RD, HT with IgG4-positive plasma cells is histopathologically distinct entity with some geographic variability."
