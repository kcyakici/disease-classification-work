Consequently, thyrotropin (TSH) cutoff-values for pregnancy are continuously a subject for debate. In subclinical hypothyroidism, altered levels of thyroid hormones may affect mitochondrial function.Objectives were i) to analyze thyroid hormone levels in offspring of women with and without subclinical hypothyroidism ii) to analyze mitochondrial ""robustness"" in terms of MTG/TMRM ratio in pregnant women and their offspring in relation to thyroid function and iii) to perform differentiate analyses on different TSH thresholds to determine the importance of cutoff-values to results.Pregnant women were included by blood collections prior to a planned cesarean section, and cord samples were collected after delivery. Thyroid status (analyzed by Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics by an electrochemical luminescent immunoassay based on LOCI-technology) grouped the women and their offspring in euthyroid or subclinical hypothyroid, with groups established from previous recommended third-trimester cutoff-value (TSH > 3.0 mIU/L) and the recently recommended cutoff-value in Denmark (TSH > 3.7 mIU/L). Flow cytometric measurements of mitochondrial function in mononuclear blood cells with the fluorophores TetraMethylRhodamine Methyl Ester (TMRM) and Mitotracker Green (MTG) were used to evaluate mitochondrial robustness as the MTG/TMRM ratio.No significant differences in mitochondrial robustness between euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroid cohorts were observed, irrespective of TSH-cutoff applied. Maternal and cord MTG/TMRM ratios were positively correlated. Cord-TSH was elevated in subclinical hypothyroid offspring, independent of TSH cutoff applied. Cord-TSH was associated with maternal TSH-level, maternal smoking and cord arterial-pH."

These findings have not been confirmed in a large population database study. Therefore, a large population-based cohort study was established to study the associations between maternal hypothyroidism and pregnancy and perinatal complications.
This is a retrospective population-based cohort study utilizing data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project-Nationwide Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS) over 11 years from 2004 to 2014. A cohort of all deliveries between 2004 and 2014 inclusive, was created. Within this group, all deliveries to women with hypothyroidism were identified as part of the study group (
Maternal hypothyroidism is associated with several pregnancy and perinatal complications, including gestational diabetes mellitus (aOR 1.43, 95%CI 1.38-1.47), gestational hypertension (aOR 1.17, 95%CI 1.11-1.22) and preeclampsia (aOR 1.21, 95%CI 1.16-1.27) (all 
Women with hypothyroidism are more likely to experience pregnancy, delivery and neonatal complications. We found an association between hypothyroidism and hypertensive disorders, postpartum hemorrhage, transfusions, infections, preterm delivery and hysterectomy, among other problems. This data from a population sized database confirms the findings of smaller previous studies in the literature."
3,37932394,2023-11-07,Using machine learning algorithm to analyse the hypothyroidism complications caused by radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer.,N/A,"Machine learning algorithms were used to analyze the odds and predictors of complications of thyroid damage after radiation therapy in patients with head and neck cancer. This study used decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to evaluate predictors for the data of 137 head and neck cancer patients. Candidate factors included gender, age, thyroid volume, minimum dose, average dose, maximum dose, number of treatments, and relative volume of the organ receiving X dose (X: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 Gy). The algorithm was optimized according to these factors and tenfold cross-validation to analyze the state of thyroid damage and select the predictors of thyroid dysfunction. The importance of the predictors identified by the three machine learning algorithms was ranked: the top five predictors were age, thyroid volume, average dose, V50 and V60. Of these, age and volume were negatively correlated with thyroid damage, indicating that the greater the age and thyroid volume, the lower the risk of thyroid damage; the average dose, V50 and V60 were positively correlated with thyroid damage, indicating that the larger the average dose, V50 and V60, the higher the risk of thyroid damage. The RF algorithm was most accurate in predicting the probability of thyroid damage among the three algorithms optimized using the above factors. The Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.827 and the accuracy (ACC) was 0.824. This study found that five predictors (age, thyroid volume, mean dose, V50 and V60) are important factors affecting the chance that patients with head and neck cancer who received radiation therapy will develop hypothyroidism. Using these factors as the prediction basis of the algorithm and using RF to predict the occurrence of hypothyroidism had the highest ACC, which was 82.4%. This algorithm is quite helpful in predicting the probability of radiotherapy complications. It also provides references for assisting medical decision-making in the future."

However, a standardized treatment protocol with regard to radioactive iodine treatment (RAI) remains subject to discussion. We retrospectively analyzed 100 patient records. Patient diagnosis, age, gender, body mass index (BMI), dose of radioactive iodine, thyroid size, the 24h radioiodine uptake (24h RAIU) and protein bound iodine (PBI) were deducted, as well as the use of antithyroid drugs prior to RAI. Biochemical parameters were obtained, such as TSH, fT4, fT3, Anti-TPO, Anti-TG antibodies and thyroid stimulating antibodies. After 5 years of follow-up, 46% of the patients proved to be hypothyroid, whereas 8% of the patients were not cured after one dose of RAI. One year after RAI, a larger proportion of patients with a toxic nodule developed hypothyroidism compared to patients with a multinodular goitre (MNG) (44.2% vs. 21.2%). Radioactive iodine dose, PBI, RAIU, BMI, size of the thyroid gland, diagnosis, age and TPO-antibodies showed statistically significant differences in the development of hypothyroidism. Furthermore, thiamazole pretherapy was shown to be a predictor of hypothyroidism, as well as a high PBI value, exhibiting a positive predictive value of 85.2% when the PBI exceeded 0.16. We suggest a standardized measurement of TPO-Ab's to further determine their role in the development of hypothyroidism after RAI. The empirical dosing regimen was very effective, illustrating a 92% cure rate after 1 dose. We suggest a lowering of therapeutic dosage in patients with PBI values ranging from 0.17 to 0.39 to minimize hypothyroidism after RAI."

Some patients may present with refractory hypothyroidism despite a high daily LT4 dose. We report the case of a 49-year-old woman who was admitted to our department for refractory hypothyroidism. She was treated with 300 μg oral LT4 tablets daily (3.9 μg/kg/day). Despite good compliance and regular intake of high doses of LT4, she had persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism and a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 92.4 mIU/L. LT4 absorption test was consistent with the diagnosis of malabsorption. Etiological investigations revealed Helicobacter pylori gastritis. Helicobacter infection was adequately treated, but symptoms of hypothyroidism and elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone persisted. Increased LT4 doses (400 μg) failed to normalize thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. Thus, she was put on LT4 liquid form at a dose of 80 drops/day per day (400 µg). Two weeks later, she presented with clinical and biological improvement with a normal free thyroxine level of 1.14 ng/dL. Patients with gastrointestinal disorders may present with refractory hypothyroidism despite increasing doses of LT4. Switching to liquid formulation may resolve this problem."

Clinical features can be insidious in nature, often under the guise of non-specific presentations to other subspecialties prior to referral to the endocrinologist. Growth failure is a hallmark feature in these children alongside their presenting clinical symptomology which needs to be identified through detailed history, physical examination and analysis of the growth charts. In this case series, we discuss 5 atypical presentations of acquired primary hypothyroidism with multisystemic involvement, including musculoskeletal, hepatobiliary, gynaecological and haematological manifestations. This is of importance as untreated hypothyroidism leads to fatigue, decreased physical activity, suboptimal height gain, disordered puberty and poor neurocognitive development in children with long term detrimental outcomes."

To estimate the effect of initiation of levothyroxine on pregnancy loss among women with SCH with an emulated target trial using observational data.
We emulated a target trial using the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink to account for the staggered timing of diagnosis and treatment of SCH and the time of entry of women into prenatal care. We emulated multiple nested trials (at each gestational week) and used an intention-to-treat approach to define levothyroxine use (≥1 prescription in the 7 days prior to trial entry), with eligible users matched to non-users (1:4) on time of diagnosis, gestational week of the first eligible trial and high-dimensional propensity score. Pregnancy losses included spontaneous abortion and stillbirth. A pooled logistic regression model with bootstrap resampling was used to estimate the hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).
Based on 159,177 eligible person-trials (5781 women), the matched cohort included 181 initiators and 640 non-initiators of levothyroxine, with 57 pregnancy losses occurring during follow-up. Overall, the mean age of women was 32.2 years (SD 5.4), 25% were obese, 8% had type 2 diabetes and about 50% were nulliparous. After matching, women who initiated levothyroxine versus not had higher thyroid-stimulating levels during pregnancy and were more likely to have a history of hypothyroidism. The cumulative incidence of pregnancy loss was lower in initiators versus non-initiators of levothyroxine. The adjusted HR for pregnancy loss was 0.87 (95% CI 0.22, 1.56).
Although our assessment of the effect of initiation of levothyroxine for SCH in pregnancy precludes any definitive conclusions due to wide confidence intervals, this study illustrates the feasibility of using the target trial emulation framework to examine the effectiveness of medication use in pregnancy."

The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and factors influencing the comorbidity of subclinical hypothyroidism in patients with dyslipidemic MDD who were hospitalized for the first time in a Chinese population.
The study incorporated 708 first-time hospitalized MDD patients, all with dyslipidemia. Data collection encompassed socio-demographic information, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose (FBG), lipid, and thyroid hormone levels. Participants were evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), and Positive Symptom Subscale (PSS).
The prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in dyslipidemic MDD patients with the first hospitalization was 39.97%. The course of the disease, age at onset, HAMA score, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were risk factors for subclinical hypothyroidism in dyslipidemic MDD patients. The course of disease, age at onset, HAMA score, HAMD score, FBG, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) levels were observed to influence serum Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels.
MDD patients with dyslipidemia have a high prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism, and the outcome is associated with anxiety, fasting glucose, and lipids. This study provides a potential biomarker for the identification of co-morbid subclinical hypothyroidism in MDD patients with dyslipidaemia."

This study evaluates the potential association between subclinical hypothyroidism and T2DM in Qatar.
A cross-sectional study used participants with and without T2DM from the Qatar Biobank (QBB). Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between subclinical hypothyroidism and T2DM, with multivariable logistic regression used to adjust for potential confounders.
The study found that subclinical hypothyroidism was significantly associated with a 2.82 increase in the odds of having T2DM (OR=2.82, 95% CI (1.13, 7.02), p=0.026) after adjusting for potential confounders. The proportion of subclinical hypothyroidism among individuals with T2DM in Qatar was 4.6%, significantly higher than in those without T2DM (2.8%, p=0.18).
This study demonstrates a significant association between subclinical hypothyroidism and T2DM in Qatar. Further research is required to investigate the directionality of this association and its clinical implications."

The 312 pregnant women without GH were randomly selected during the same time period. They were respectively allocated into the study group and the control group for further comparison of clinical characteristics and pregnancy outcomes.
There were significant differences in parameters including age, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, gravidity, parity, spontaneous abortion, history of gestation, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3), Thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPO-Ab), and free thyroxine (FT4) differ significantly between the two groups (P<0.05). Moreover, significant differences were found between the two groups in terms of preterm delivery, preeclampsia, premature rupture of membranes, placental abruption, and postpartum hemorrhage (P<0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the influencing factors of pregnancy outcome in patients with GH were age (≥ 30 years old), gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, gravidity (≥ 3 times), spontaneous abortion, parity, history of gestation (multiparity), and TPO-Ab (positive).

11,37908940,2023-11-01,"Epidemiology, Types, Causes, Clinical Presentation, Diagnosis, and Treatment of Hypothyroidism.","deficiency"", ""hypothyroidism"", ""levothyroxine"", ""thyroxine"", ""tsh","Hypothyroidism means an underactive thyroid gland. This leads to a decrease in the functioning of the thyroid gland. It is a very common endocrine disorder that causes under-secretion of thyroid hormones, mainly thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). It affects people of every age group but is more commonly found in women and older people. The symptoms of hypothyroidism can go unnoticed, may not be specific, and may overlap with other conditions, which makes it harder to diagnose it in some cases. Common symptoms include fatigue, weight gain, increased sensitivity to cold (cold intolerance), irregular bowel movements (constipation), and dry skin (xeroderma). These conditions are mostly the result of a low metabolic rate in the body. Weight gain occurs due to a decrease in fat-burning rate and cold intolerance due to a decrease in heat production by the body. This condition can be caused by a variety of factors, including autoimmune diseases, radiation therapy, thyroid gland removal surgeries, and certain medications. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism is based on laboratory tests that measure the levels of thyroid hormones (T3 and T4) in the blood. Treatment typically involves lifelong hormone replacement therapy with synthetic thyroid hormone replacement medication, such as levothyroxine, to help regulate hormone levels in the body. People with hypothyroidism may need to have their medication dosage adjusted over time. If hypothyroidism is left untreated, it can lead to severe complications like mental retardation, delayed milestones, etc., in infants and heart failure, infertility, myxedema coma, etc., in adults. With appropriate treatment, the symptoms of hypothyroidism can be effectively managed, and most people with the condition can lead normal, healthy lives. Lifestyle modifications like eating healthy food and exercising regularly can help manage the symptoms and improve the quality of life."

Incorporating children into follow-up programs could be very helpful.
To evaluate the cognitive performance of preschool children with CH incorporated into a follow- up program.
Prospective study of 93 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of CH. Intelligence quotient (IQ) was assessed using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Intelligence Scale (WPPSI) at 4 and 5 years, and the WISC-R at 6 years of age. Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ), Verbal IQ (VIQ), and Performance IQ (PIQ) scores were analyzed.
The study sample was 80 children. The average age at starting hormonal treatment was 42 ± 18 days; treatment started early in 25 patients (24 ± 6 days) and late in 55 patients (50 ± 16 days). The mean initial dose of Levothyroxine was 13.5 ± 1.5µg/kg/day. Children with athyrosis and late initiation of treatment had lower scores on the VIQ (85 ± 14), the PIQ (89 ± 12), and the FSIQ (86 ± 13) scales at 4 years of age, in comparison with patients with early initiation of treatment. These patients scored within the cut-off point for the normal IQ classification (90-109 points). IQ comparison at 6 years of age revealed differences up to 14 points in the PIQ and 11 points in the FSIQ between children with athyrosis and early initiation of treatment, with and without regular attendance to the follow-up program.
These results support the importance of early initiation of treatment and the incorporation of children in follow-up programs and early stimulation. The etiology of hypothyroidism and the age at initiation of treatment were the most significant factors that affected cognitive performance."

Considering the neuroprotective properties of thiamine (Vitamin B1), this study was conducted to investigate the effects of thiamine on acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, oxidative damage, and memory deficits in hypothyroid rats.In this study, 50 rats (21 days old) were randomly divided into 5 groups and treated with propylthiouracil (0.05% in drinking water) and thiamine (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, oral) for 7 weeks. Following that, Morris water maze (MWM) and passive avoidance (PA) tests were performed. Finally, oxidative stress indicators and AChE activity were measured in brain tissue.Treatment of hypothyroid rats with thiamine, especially at 100 and 200 mg/kg, alleviated the ability to remember the location of the platform as reflected by less time spent and distance to reach the platform, during the MWM test (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001). In the PA test, the latency to enter the dark chamber and light stay time were increased in rats who received thiamine compared to the hypothyroid group (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001). In addition, thiamine increased the levels of total thiol groups and superoxide dismutase while decreasing the levels of malondialdehyde and AChE.Our results suggest that thiamine supplementation could effectively improve memory loss in a rat model of hypothyroidism. The positive effects of thiamin on the learning and memory of hypothyroid rats may be due to amelioration of redox hemostasis and cholinergic disturbance."

20,37897184,2023-10-28,Optimising levothyroxine treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism during pregnancy.,"dose titration"", ""levothyroxine"", ""pregnancy"", ""subclinical hypothyroidism","The onset of pregnancy places additional stress of the thyroid gland, which must produce additional thyroid hormones to support the developing foetus. Hypothyroidism, including subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) may appear de novo at this time, or existing thyroid disease may become more severe. Accordingly, SCH is a relatively common complication of up to about 3% of pregnancies, with higher rates in some areas. There is strong evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses that uncontrolled SCH is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including miscarriage, preeclampsia, gestational diabetes. The evidence base also suggests that treatment with levothyroxine (LT4), optimised to control thyrotropin (TSH) to within it pregnancy-specific reference ranges, reduces these risks. Current management guidelines provide a clear framework of intervention with LT4 in pregnant women with SCH, especially where TSH is high or where thyroperoxidase autoantibodies are present. Sub-optimal adherence to LT4 is common: it is important that patients take their LT4 correctly and that treating physicians and/or healthcare professionals manage these patients according to the latest management guidelines. The titration of LT4 is likely to occur within a range of LT4 daily doses between 25 g and 75 g for the majority of this population. LT4 is a narrow therapeutic index drug and small variations in dosage may produce a clinically significant change in thyroid status. Newer formulations of LT4, engineered to provide more precise and consistent dosing, and with a broad range of tablet strengths, may facilitate the precise titration of the LT4 dose for these patients."

CH is classified as transient or permanent, primary or secondary, with primary CH being the most common neonatal endocrine disorder. Most patients with CH do not present any typical signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism shortly after birth, partly due to transplacental maternal thyroid hormone transfer and residual neonatal thyroid function. This paper reports on two CH cases. During the initial Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) admission phase, CH was not suspected due to nonspecific signs. The distinct characteristics of our cases are as follows: both infants were admitted to the NICU for respiratory distress syndrome, requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, and both were born to diabetic mothers. Following extubation, they both showed similar neurological issues, including reduced muscle tone and feeding difficulties. Initially, those symptoms were attributed to delayed clearance of analgesic and sedative medication. However, symptoms progressively worsened over time. Subsequent tests revealed both meeting CH diagnostic criteria: an unusual ultrasound indicating thyroid agenesis and abnormal hormone levels. Guided by the pediatric endocrinology team, prompt hormonal treatment was started with improvements in neurocognitive function and feeding. Usually, CH screening involves blood samples from healthy newborns at 2-3 days of life. Abnormal results require confirmation, prompting treatment within two weeks. Certain NICU-admitted infants face higher diagnosis delays, as seen in those two cases where CH screening was postponed. Thus, for all neonates with persistent pathologies unresponsive to standard etiological treatment, conducting a comprehensive anamnestic evaluation of the medical history, along with maternal preconceptional and prenatal nutrition, is recommended."

Hypothyroidism was defined as TSH ≥ 4.5 mU/L. Plaques were determined based on quantification of coronary calcium and coronary CT angiography.
A total 2499 patients (1544 males and 955 females) were included. The prevalence of hypothyroidism was significantly higher in females than males (18.0% versus 12.9%, p<0.001), in all patients and those <65 years. Hypothyroidism in males was significantly associated with higher coronary calcium score (CCS)>0, higher CCS groups, and both soft and calcified plaques (p=0.027, p=0.032, p=0.005, and p=0.017, respectively). After adjusting for traditional coronary risk factors, the higher risk in males remained significant for coronary plaque but not for CCS>0 (odds ratios and confidence intervals were 1.77, 1.08-2.90, p=0.023 and 0.98, 0.63-1.52, p=0.925, respectively). On the other hand, hypothyroidism in females was not significantly associated with coronary calcification nor plaques in both univaraite and multivariateanalysis.
There is sex-specific differences in the association of hypothyroidism with subclinical atherosclerosis. The higher risk of coronary plaques but not calcification in males was independent of traditional coronary risk factors. The lack of associations in females may be related to lower underlying risk of CAD."

An observational study with 77 singleton-pregnant women included by thyroid screening before a planned cesarean section. Two TSH-cutoffs (3.0 and 3.7 mIU/L) defined euthyroid and SCH groups, and were applied to evaluate offspring anthropometrics, complication rates (maternal blood loss, Apgar-score, cord arterial-pH, admission to neonatal intensive care unit, perinatal hypoglycemia) and offspring development. Development was evaluated by Bayley-III test in a subsample at age 6 months (n=27) and 15 months (n=22).
Prevalence of SCH was 31.2 % at TSH-cutoff 3.0 mIU/L, and 16.9 % at TSH-cutoff 3.7 mIU/L. No differences in complications and anthropometrics were observed. In Bayley-III tests, cognitive score was decreased at 6 months (p=0.012) and at 15 months (p=0.056) by applying TSH-cutoff 3.0 mIU/L.

During pregnancy, TSH levels remain similar to those in preconception, even with supplementary thyroxine, whereas the serum levels of anti-TPO progressively decline.
Overt hypothyroidism impacts both pregnancy and offspring but randomized clinical trials and cohort studies failed to detect the benefit of treatment with thyroxine in cases with low-threshold TSH or with anti-TPO during pregnancy.
First, the prevalence and reproducibility of two candidate cut-off levels of subclinical hypothyroidism in a cohort of 177 infertile women was compared with 171 women not aiming for pregnancy. Second, the impact of distinct setpoints of TSH in preconception (with or without anti-TPO) was monitored during pregnancy in 87 previously infertile women by high-frequency monitoring of thyroid function. Both studies were carried out from 2007 to 2019.
Reproducibility and prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism were examined in infertile women presenting in the fertility care unit of an academic institution. Women not aiming for pregnancy participated as controls. In both groups, TSH and anti-TPO were measured two times on different occasions. In addition, a group of previously infertile women with known preconception setpoints of TSH (with or without anti-TPO) were followed up prospectively throughout pregnancy and after birth. During pregnancy, serum was sampled weekly until Week 12, then monthly until delivery, and once after birth. Only cases with preconception TSH >4.5 mIU/l were supplemented with thyroxine. After collection of all samples, the serum levels of anti-TPO and the major thyroid hormones were measured. Prolactin with known fluctuations during pregnancy was used as reference.
Measures of both TSH and anti-TPO at two different time points were accurate and reproducible. The odds of subclinical hypothyroidism in infertile women and controls were similar. During pregnancy, TSH closely followed preconception TSH levels, whereas serum levels of the thyroid hormones predominantly remained within or above (not below) the reference. Treatment of infertile women with preconception TSH >4.5 mIU/l with thyroxine resulted in higher free thyroxine (fT4) serum levels. The serum levels of anti-TPO declined as pregnancies evolved.
The numbers of participants both in the prevalence study and in pregnancy did not reach the 
We propose to use >4.5 mIU/l as the serum TSH threshold for supplementing women with thyroxine before pregnancy. During pregnancy, fT4 may be the better marker to monitor thyroid function. The consistent decrease of anti-TPO antibody levels during ongoing pregnancies must be considered a protective element.

In the pre-trial phase, TSH levels normalized in 60.8% of participants in a median follow-up of one year. In the in-trial phase, levels normalized in 39.9% of participants after one year follow-up. Younger age, female sex, lower initial TSH level, higher initial fT4 level, absence of thyroid peroxidase antibodies, and a follow-up measurement in summer were independent determinants for normalization.
Since TSH levels spontaneously normalized in a large proportion of older adults with subclinical hypothyroidism (also after confirmation by repeat measurement), a third measurement may be recommended before considering treatment."

The Dutch NBS is based on measuring total thyroxine (T4) from dried blood spots, aiming to detect primary and central CH at the cost of more false-positive referrals (FPRs) (positive predictive value (PPV) of 21% in 2007-2017). An artificial PPV of 26% was yielded when using a machine learning-based model on the adjusted dataset described based on the Dutch CH NBS. Recently, amino acids (AAs) and acylcarnitines (ACs) have been shown to be associated with TH concentration. We therefore aimed to investigate whether AAs and ACs measured during NBS can contribute to better performance of the CH screening in the Netherlands by using a revised machine learning-based model.

Presence of comorbidity was based on data obtained using structured questionnaires, physical examination, biochemical measurements and verified medication use. Single morbidities were clustered into 14 different disease domains. HRQoL was measured using the RAND-36. Logistic regression analyses were used to determine the effect of TH use on the odds of having an affected disease domain and a lower score than an age- and sex-specific reference value for HRQoL. TH was used by 4537/14,7201 participants of the population-based Lifelines cohort with a mean (± s.d.) age of 51.0 ± 12.8 years (88% females). Eighty-five percent of the TH users had ≥1 affected disease domain in contrast to 71% of nonusers. TH use was associated with a higher odds of 13 out of 14 affected disease domains independent of age and sex. In a multivariable model, TH use was associated with a decreased HRQoL across six out of eight dimensions. No significant interactions between TH use and affected disease domains were observed. TH users with an impaired HRQoL had significantly more comorbidity than those not having an impaired HRQoL. In this large, population-based study, we demonstrated that TH users had more comorbidity than individuals not using TH.

Pioglitazone (PIO), which is used to treat diabetes mellitus, has shown potential for treating hypothyroidism and cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, this study explores whether PIO can also ameliorate DOX-induced hypothyroidism and cardiotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty female Wistar rats were separated into control and three treated groups (DOX, PIO, and DOX+PIO), and their blood samples were examined for the thyroid hormones, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroxine in total and free forms (T4 and FT4, respectively), and triiodothyronine in total and free forms (T3 and FT3, respectively), and the cardiotoxicity biomarkers [troponin I, creatine kinase (CK), and creatine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB)]. RESULTS: The control and PIO groups did not exhibit significant alterations in any of the examined hormones and markers. In contrast, in the DOX group, T4, FT4, T3, and FT3 levels decreased significantly, whereas troponin I, CK, and CK-MB levels increased significantly, but no significant changes were detected in TSH levels. PIO co-treatment ameliorated these effects of DOX significantly in FT4, FT3, and troponin I. CONCLUSIONS: PIO may provide protection against hypothyroidism and cardiotoxicity caused by DOX treatment, by significant reversal of FT4, FT3, and troponin I levels.

We also analysed whether there is an association between this biochemical picture and treatment with antidepressant and antipsychotic medications, and how common this is.
We performed a retrospective observational study of patients across nine different hospitals in South Wales. We analysed patients referred to endocrinology at each site over a 6-year period with unexplained isolated biochemical central hypothyroidism.
1022 individual patients' thyroid function test results were identified from our biochemical database using our inclusion criteria. After exclusion criteria were applied, 71 patients' results were analysed as to the final pathophysiology of their central hypothyroidism.
Of the 71 patients included in the study, none were found to have any clinically significant pathology on pituitary imaging. On reviewing their medications, 46/71 (65%) were found to be taking psychotropic medications.
Our study strongly suggests isolated central hypothyroidism, in the absence of other pituitary hormone dysfunction or visual field defect, does not require further investigation, saving resources as well as sparing patients unnecessary anxiety. It also strongly supports a relationship between patients taking psychotropic medications and biochemical isolated central hypothyroidism, an association only described in a very limited amount of literature before this, and further supporting our previous single-centre study findings. The mechanism behind this is likely to be the suppression of thyrotropin secretion via antagonism of the dopamine-serotoninergic pathway. In our opinion, patients found to have isolated biochemical central hypothyroidism who are taking psychotropic medications can therefore be regarded to have a recognised cause for this biochemical finding and do not require further radiological investigation."

Here, we reviewed the PubMed and examined gene mutations and SNPs in the TH cellular transporters, deiodinases, and TH receptors, along with their impact on TH signaling, and potential clinical implications.
In some mechanisms, such as the Thr92Ala-DIO2 SNP, there is a compelling rationale for reduced T4 to T3 activation that limits the effectiveness of LT4 to restore euthyroidism. In other mechanisms, a potential case can be made but more studies with a larger number of individuals are needed.

Summary statistics for hypothyroidism were obtained from two distinct sources: the FinnGen consortium R9 release data (40,926 cases and 274,069 controls) and the UK Biobank data (22,687 cases and 440,246 controls), respectively. A two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design was employed, and thorough sensitivity analyses were carried out to ensure the reliability of the results.
Based on the FinnGen consortium, we found increased levels of Intestinimonas (OR = 1.09; 95%CI = 1.02-1.16; P = 0.01) and Ruminiclostridium5 (OR = 1.11; 95%CI = 1.02-1.22; P = 0.02) may be associated with a higher risk of hypothyroidism, while increased levels of Butyrivibrio (OR = 0.95; 95%CI = 0.92-0.99; P = 0.02), Eggerthella (OR = 0.93; 95%CI = 0.88-0.98; P = 0.01), Lachnospiraceae UCG008 (OR = 0.92; 95%CI = 0.85-0.99; P = 0.02), Ruminococcaceae UCG011 (OR = 0.95; 95%CI = 0.90-0.99; P = 0.02), and Actinobacteria (OR = 0.88; 95%CI = 0.80-0.97; P = 0.01) may be associated with a lower risk. According to the UK Biobank data, Eggerthella and Ruminiclostridium5 remain causally associated with hypothyroidism. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates consistent results without evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy.
This study highlights the impact of specific gut microbiota on hypothyroidism. Strategies to change composition of gut microbiota may hold promise as potential interventions."

A total of 130 patients with SH were recruited for this study. Thirty-five (26.9%) patients were followed up without levothy-roxine (L-T4) (SH-T0 group) and therapy with L-T4 was randomly introduced in 95/130 (73.1%) SH children (SH-T1 group). We did not find statistical differences in hSDS and BMI Z-score between the SH-T0 and SH-T1 groups (p = 0.761 and p = 0.843, respectively). Introducing L-T4 in patients with short stature did not affect the linear growth at the end of FU ex-pressed as hSDS. OH developed in six children (6.3%) in the SH-T1 group. After conducting a multivariate logistic regres-sion, we found that the baseline TSH concentration and BMI Z-score are possible predictors of OH.
Our study confirmed a low risk of progression of SH to overt hypothyroidism. The majority of patients remains SH or resolved for nor-mal thyroid function. The L-T4 therapy did not effect on linear growth and body weight. The main predictor of worsening to hypothyroidism were a higher TSH level and Z-score BMI.

In addition, we wished to test if applied TSH-cutoff significantly changed our results of expressed gene-levels. Moreover, we aimed to identify potential microRNA-biomarkers for subclinical hypothyroidism - markers that could be traced to offspring as well.
From a cohort of at-term pregnant women undergoing planned cesarean section, 77 women had expression levels of the mitochondria-related genes Peroxisome Proliferator-activated Receptor-γ coactivator-1β (PGC-1β), mitochondrial Transcription Factor A (TFAM), Superoxide Dismutase 2 (SOD2) and Nuclear Respiratory Factor 2 (NRF-2) determined by qPCR from blood sampled in prior to delivery. Two TSH-cutoff levels defining subclinical hypothyroidism (> 3.0 and > 3.7 mIU/L) were applied for the procession of results, generating two data analyses of the same cohort. In 22 pairwise maternal-cord samples (subclinical hypothyroid/euthyroid-rate 0.5, TSH-cutoff > 3.0 mIU/L), microRNA-expressions (miRNA) were analyzed.
All gene expressions were lower in the subclinical hypothyroid group regardless of applied TSH-cutoff, but insignificant except for PGC-1β at TSH cutoff > 3.0 mIU/L. Two miRNAs (hsa-let-7d-3p and hsa-miR-345-5p) were upregulated in blood from women and offspring (cord blood) with subclinical hypothyroidism.
A trend towards decreased mitochondrial gene expressions in subclinical hypothyroidism were demonstrated. The miRNAs hsa-let-7d-3p and hsa-miR-345-5p might be potential markers of maternal subclinical hypothyroidism. However, larger studies are needed to verify the findings."

It is defined as the inability to achieve disease control despite using levothyroxine (LT4) doses of 1.9 μg/kg/d or higher.
A comprehensive review, encompassing 103 articles, was conducted using the Scielo, Scopus, and EMBASE databases, providing an approach to evaluation and diagnosis of this condition.
LT4 disintegrates and dissolves within an acidic gastric environment before being absorbed in the jejunum and ileum. It then extensively binds to serum transporter proteins and undergoes deiodination to yield tri-iodothyronine, the biologically active hormone. There are various nonpathological causes of RH, such as noncompliance with treatment, changes in the brand of LT4, food and drug interferences, as well as pregnancy. Pathological causes include lactose intolerance, Helicobacter pylori infection, giardiasis, among others. The diagnosis of RH involves conducting a thorough medical history and requesting relevant laboratory tests to rule out causes of treatment resistance. The LT4 absorption test allows for the identification of cases of malabsorption. The treatment of RH involves identifying and addressing the underlying causes of noncompliance or malabsorption. In cases of pseudomalabsorption, supervised and weekly administration of LT4 may be considered.
Early recognition of RH and correction of its underlying cause are of utmost importance, as this avoids the use of excessive doses of LT4 and prevents cardiovascular and bone complications associated with this condition."

The participants were categorized into 3 groups: euthyroid (226 participants), subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) (75 participants), and overt hypothyroidism (23 participants). Fasting lipid profile was tested as: cholesterol (Chol), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL). A significant relationship between hypothyroidism and dyslipidemia was noticed. LDL, TG, and Chol but not HDL showed a significant difference between study groups (euthyroidism, subclinical, and overt hypothyroidism). The lowest levels of these parameters were in euthyroidism and increased in subclinical and overt hypothyroidism subsequently. Overt hypothyroidism showed a significant difference in LDL, TG, and Chol compared to euthyroidism, however, we did not find a difference in lipid parameters in SCH compared to euthyroidism. LDL and Chol showed significant differences between subclinical and overt hypothyroidism. TSH had a positive weak correlation with LDL, TG, and Chol, however, there was no correlation with HDL. Also, FT4 had a negative weak correlation with LDL, TG, and Chol, however, there was a positive correlation with HDL. Our findings suggest a higher level of lipids (LDL, TG, and Chol) among SCH and overt hypothyroidism compared to general population. A weak correlations of lipid parameters with TSH and FT4 were detected. It is not well evident whether a restoration of euthyroidism might influence the morbidity and mortality, especially cardiovascular comorbidities, in this population, which mandates future studies."

Over the past decade, the crosstalk between gut microbiota and the host immune system has been well-recognised, identifying the gut microbiome as an important factor in host health and disease, including susceptibility to autoimmune diseases. Previous observational studies yielded a link between disruption of the gut microbiome composition and HT. This is the first study that investigates the potential of restoring a disrupted gut microbiome with faecal microbiota transplantations (FMTs) to halt disease progression and dampen autoimmunity.
The IMITHOT trial is a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study evaluating either autologous or allogenic FMTs in medication-naïve patients with subclinical autoimmune hypothyroidism. In total, 34 patients will be enrolled to receive either three allogenic or autologous FMTs. FMT will be made of fresh stool and directly administered into the duodenum. Patients will be evaluated at baseline before the first FMT is administered and at 6, 12 and 24 months post-intervention to assess efficacy and adverse events. The primary outcome measure will be the net incremental increase (incremental area under the curve) on thyrotropin-stimulated free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine release at 6 and 12 months compared with baseline. Results will be disseminated via peer-reviewed journals and international conferences. The recruitment of the first patient and donor occurred on 18 December 2019.
Ethics approval was obtained from the hospital Ethics Committee (Medical Ethics Committee) at Amsterdam University Medical Center. The trial's outcomes offer high-quality evidence that aids in unveiling distinct patterns within the gut microbiota potentially associated with improved thyroid function. Consequently, this may open avenues for the future clinical applications of microbial-targeted therapy in individuals at risk of developing overt HT.

One was designated the developmental cohort, the other as the external validation cohort. We compared the performances of machine learning models with those of published normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) models.
The developmental and external validation cohorts consisted of 378 and 49 patients, respectively. The estimated cumulative incidence rates of grade ≥1 hypothyroidism were 53.5% and 61.3% in the developmental and external validation cohorts, respectively. Machine learning models outperformed traditional NTCP models by having lower Brier scores at every time point and a lower integrated Brier score, while demonstrating a comparable calibration index and mean area under the curve. Even simplified machine learning models using only thyroid features performed better than did traditional NTCP algorithms. The machine learning models showed consistent performance between folds. The performance in a previously unseen external validation cohort was comparable to that of the cross-validation.
Our model outperformed traditional NTCP models, with additional capabilities of predicting the RIHT risk at individual time points. A simplified model using only thyroid dose-volume features still outperforms traditional NTCP models and can be incorporated into future treatment planning systems for biological optimization."

A total of 328 patients with CH were screened for TPO variants by performing whole exome sequencing. The function of the detected TPO variants was investigated via transfection assays in vitro. The pathogenic effect of five novel variants was further assessed in silico.
Among 328 patients with CH, 19 TPO variants, including six novel ones, were identified in 43 patients. Eighteen patients (5.5%) carried biallelic TPO variants. In vitro experiments showed that TPO activity was impaired to varying degrees in 17 variants. Furthermore, we determined that a residual TPO enzyme activity threshold of 15% may serve as a criterion for differentiating CH severity.
According to our study, the prevalence of TPO variants among Chinese patients with CH was 13.1 %. Five novel variants led to impaired TPO function by altering its structure or by affecting its expression or cellular localization, which should result in impaired thyroid hormone synthesis."

Hypothyroid women received appropriate treatment with no increase in adverse pregnancy outcomes. Almost a third of women from low to mid socio-economic population had hypothyroidism in early pregnancy, more so if anemic and overweight or obese.

Exclusion criteria were twin- and assisted reproduction pregnancies, TPO positivity, overt thyroid dysfunction, and treatment with LT4 before screening. The impact of LT4 on maternal pregnancy outcomes was investigated in a group of 53 women with SCH (TSH > 3.74 mIU/L) in which LT4 was initiated at median 13 (10-22) weeks (treated group). The control group included 18 women with SCH (TSH > 3.74 mIU/L). The prevalence of pregnancy complications in these two groups was compared with that in a euthyroid reference (REF) group of 1389 women (TSH ≤ 3.74 mIU/L).
The prevalence of pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes (GDM) was higher in the control group vs the REF group (16.7% vs 5.0% and 27.8% vs 18.9%; p = 0.017 and p = 0.016, respectively), but comparable in the treated group vs the REF group (7.6% vs 5.0% and 22.6% vs 18.9%; p = 0.918 and 0.676, respectively). The prevalence of iron-deficiency anaemia was lower in the treated vs the REF group (17.0% vs 32.5%; p = 0.017).
Pregnant women with untreated SCH and without TPOAb positivity had a higher prevalence of pre-eclampsia and GDM compared with euthyroid women, while this was not the case in women with treated SCH, even when it was initiated after the first trimester."

This report presents an updated review of the prevalence and prognosis of hypothyroidism in patients diagnosed with CTEPH, including a detailed retrospective description of the series. The descriptive case series included 34 adult patients diagnosed with CTEPH, of whom 11 patients were diagnosed with hypothyroidism. The prevalence of hypothyroidism in CTEPH was found to be 32.35%. All patients with hypothyroidism had NYHA functional Class II-III. Hemodynamic values obtained through right heart catheterization (RHC) showed that patients with hypothyroidism had significantly higher mean pulmonary arterial pressures (mPAP), with a mean of 56.91 mm Hg vs 43.93 mm Hg (p = 0.026), and the PVR in dynes/sec/cm5 was 932 vs 541 (p = 0.027). Significant differences in PVR were found in wood units (WU) 11.91 vs 7.11 (p = 0.042). The mean level of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) between both groups was 797.3 pg/mL for patients with hypothyroidism vs 262.02 pg/mL in patients with euthyroidism (p = .032). Hypothyroidism may significantly affect patients' clinical and hemodynamic outcomes in patients with CTEPH. Hypothyroidism as a risk factor in the evaluation and treatment of these patients is vital to optimize outcomes in CTEPH; further research is warranted whether hypothyroidism therapies could alter such outcomes."

In this systematic review of the literature, we aimed to characterize and quantify the published evidence on RT-related hypothyroidism, including estimated incidence, clinical risk factors, and dosimetric parameters that may be used to guide clinical decision making. Furthermore, we aimed to identify potential areas of improvement in the prevention and clinical management of RT-induced hypothyroidism, including the role of modern advanced therapeutic techniques. (2) Methods: We conducted a systemic review of the literature in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify original research articles describing the incidence, mechanism, dosimetry, treatment, or prevention of radiation-related hypothyroidism for adults receiving RT for the treatment of head and neck cancers. The snowball method was used to identify additional articles. For identified articles, we tabulated several datapoints, including publication date, patient sample size, estimated hypothyroidism incidence, cancer site/type, follow-up period, radiation modality and technique, use of multimodality therapy, method of thyroid function evaluation, and proposed dosimetric predictors of hypothyroidism. (3) Results: One hundred and eleven articles met inclusion criteria, reflecting a range of head and neck cancer subtypes. There was a large variation in the estimated incidence of RT-related hypothyroidism, with a median estimate of 36% (range 3% to 79%). Reported incidence increased in later publication dates, which was likely related to improved screening and longer follow up. There were a wide variety of predictive metrics used to identify patients at high risk of hypothyroidism, the most common of which were volumetric and mean dosimetrics related to the thyroid gland (Vxx%, Dmean). More recently, there has been increasing evidence to suggest that the thyroid gland volume itself and the volume of the thyroid gland spared from high-dose radiation (VSxx) may better predict thyroid function after RT. There were no identified studies investigating the role of advanced radiotherapeutic techniques such as MRI-guided RT or particle therapy to decrease RT-related hypothyroidism. Conclusions: Hypothyroidism is a common toxicity resulting from therapeutic radiation for head and neck cancer with recent estimates suggesting 40-50% of patients may experience hypothyroidism after treatment. Dosimetric predictive models are increasingly able to accurately identify patients at risk of hypothyroidism, especially those utilizing thyroid VS metrics. Further investigation regarding the potential for advanced radiotherapeutic therapies to decrease RT-induced thyroid dysfunction is needed."

However, the neural mechanisms shared and unique to these disorders and the associated alterations in brain function remain largely unknown. This study investigated the potential brain function mechanisms underlying comorbid MDD and SHypo.
Thirty MDD patients (non-comorbid group), 30 MDD patients comorbid with SHypo (comorbid group), 26 patients with SHypo, and 30 healthy controls were recruited for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). We used regional homogeneity (ReHo) to examine differences in internal cerebral activity across the four groups.
Compared with the non-comorbid group, the comorbid group exhibited significantly higher ReHo values in the right orbital part of the middle frontal gyrus (ORBmid) and bilateral middle frontal gyrus; decreased ReHo values in the right middle temporal gyrus, right thalamus, and right superior temporal gyrus, and right insula. Within the comorbid group, serum TSH levels were negatively associated with the ReHo values of the right insula; the ReHo values of the right Insula were negatively associated with the retardation factor score; the ReHo values of the right ORBmid were positively correlated with the anxiety/somatization factor scores.
These findings provide valuable clues for exploring the shared neural mechanisms between MDD and SHypo and have important implications for understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms of the comorbidity of the two disorders."

Six hundred fifty-five hyperthyroid cats treated with radioiodine; 190 clinically normal cats.
Prospective, before-and-after study. Hyperthyroid cats had serum thyroxine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and creatinine concentrations, and USG measured before and 6 months after successful treatment with radioiodine.
Of untreated hyperthyroid cats, USG was ≥1.035 in 346 (52.8%) and <1.035 in 309 (47.2%). After treatment, 279/346 (80.6%) maintained USG ≥1.035, whereas 67/346 (19.4%) became <1.035; 272/309 (88%) maintained USG <1.035, whereas 37/309 (12%) became ≥1.035. Only 22/346 (6.4%) with USG ≥1.035 developed azotemia after treatment, compared with 136/309 (44%) with <1.035 (P < .001). Of cats remaining nonazotemic, 38% had USG <1.035, compared with 20% of normal cats (P < .001). The 137 cats with iatrogenic hypothyroidism had lower USG after treatment than did 508 euthyroid cats (1.024 vs 1.035), but USGs did not change after levothyroxine supplementation. USG <1.035 had high sensitivity (86.1%) but moderate specificity (65.2%) in predicting azotemia after treatment.
Hyperthyroidism appears not to affect USG in cats. However, cats with evidence of sub-optimal concentrating ability before radioiodine treatment (USG < 1.035) are more likely to develop azotemia and unmask previously occult chronic kidney disease. Iatrogenic hypothyroidism itself did not appear to affect USG values."

Sixty-seven adult patients referred from primary care were enrolled. All patients had newly diagnosed hypothyroidism due to autoimmune thyroiditis and were treated with levothyroxine (LT4). The dose was adjusted according to thyroid function tests aiming at a normal plasma thyrotropin. Patients were stratified according to the severity of hypothyroidism in two different ways: the conventional approach (subclinical or overt hypothyroidism) and a novel approach according to the change (decrease or increase) in plasma level of free triiodothyronine index (FT3I) following LT4 treatment. The ThyPRO-39 questionnaire was used for measurement of HRQL at referral to the Endocrine Outpatient Clinic (higher score corresponds to worse HRQL).
Free thyroxine index (FT4I) at diagnosis correlated positively with the scores on the Hypothyroid Symptoms and Tiredness scales (p = 0.018 for both). In accordance, patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (n = 36) scored higher on Hypothyroid Symptoms (p = 0.029) than patients with overt hypothyroidism (n = 31). The difference in HRQL was more pronounced if patients were stratified according to the dynamics in FT3I following LT4 treatment. Thus, patients who showed a decrease in FT3I following treatment (n = 24) scored significantly worse for Anxiety (p = 0.032) and Emotional Susceptibility (p = 0.035) than patients with an increase in FT3I (n = 43).
Patients referred to an endocrine clinic with mild hypothyroidism had an impaired HRQL, compared to patients with more severe hypothyroidism. The most likely explanation of this finding is a lower threshold for seeking medical consultation and secondary care referral if HRQL is deteriorated. The dynamics in plasma FT3I following treatment may be more sensitive for such a discrimination in HRQL than a stratification according to the thyroid function tests at diagnosis."

Pembrolizumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein (PD-1) monoclonal antibody, has become a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for stage II non-small cell lung cancer since 2019. Although much more common with nivolumab, several immune-related adverse effects, particularly endocrinopathies, have been linked with pembrolizumab. We describe a case of a 59-year-old man with a history of unspecified lung cancer who presented with severe hyponatremia later attributed to secondary adrenal insufficiency and accompanying primary hypothyroidism secondary to pembrolizumab. Diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients on immune checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab can be challenging due to nonspecific symptoms, making it crucial to rule out other causes of hyponatremia. Immunotherapy is known to cause thyroid immune-related adverse events, and anti-thyroid antibodies may not always be present in the diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Although there are some reported cases of pembrolizumab-induced adrenal insufficiency, the link between immunotherapy and endocrine disorders remains unclear. To our knowledge, no case reports exist that describe both primary hypothyroidism and secondary adrenal insufficiency after taking pembrolizumab, although such cases have been documented with axitinib.

The leading causes of hypothyroidism in older adults are iatrogenic, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and medications.
The narrative review aimed to discuss the clinical characteristics of hypothyroidism in older adults and the impact of hormonal replacement therapy on survival rates.
Thyroid function declines over time due to physiological changes in the thyroid stimulating hormone signaling, iodine absorption and metabolism, thyroid hormone metabolism, and activity at peripheral sites. A serum TSH value over the upper limit of the normal reference range is not necessarily attributable to hypothyroidism. However, an appropriate diagnostic work-up is required to rule out true hypothyroidism and discriminate the etiology (i.e., thyroid autoimmune diseases, iodine deficiency, drug-induced hypothyroidism). Levothyroxine treatment should be considered in cases of overt hypothyroidism. A complete risk-to-benefit assessment, particularly considering the overall health status, life expectancy, cognitive function, mood, and cardiovascular and neurological background, should be considered before treating subclinical hypothyroidism with more potential benefits in patients under 75 years old. Levothyroxine formulations facilitating hormone absorption and increasing compliance to long-term treatment should be preferred. TSH target should usually be set over 3 mIU/ml.

There has been an acknowledged connection between diabetes, hypertension, and hypothyroidism for quite some time. However, the extent of thyroid dysfunction among the diabetic population is not uniform and significantly differs across different research studies. This study was conducted with the objective of identifying the risk factors associated with hypothyroidism as well as assessing the relationship between hypothyroidism and hypertension in patients with diabetes. (2) Materials and Methods: Participants aged 18 years and above were included in this study, while pregnant women were excluded. Trained health professionals measured sociodemographic, behavioural, food practices, and anthropometric information about the participants. Each respondent sought medical advice regarding their health, and a face-to-face interview enabled them to express concern about the likelihood of being diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. (3) Results: The study encompassed 640 participants, with an average age of 49.20 ± 13.0 years. Among these participants, 65.5% were female, and 34.5% were male. Of the total, 31.25% were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, and 18.75% had hypertension. Interestingly, co-occurrence of both conditions was observed in 9.68% of the population. A comparison of thyroid function and indicators of blood sugar levels yielded consistent results across the different patient groups. Specifically, for diabetes mellitus (DM) patients, the average levels were 3.4 ± 9.8 pg/mL for fT3, 0.9 ± 0.7 ng/dL for fT4, 3.3 ± 6.2 μiU/mL for TSH, 153.1 ± 68.0 mg/dL for fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 213.2 ± 97.2 mg/dL for postprandial glucose (PPG), and 8.3 ± 3.2% for HbA1c. (4) Conclusion: It is concluded that patients with hypertension had a significant prevalence of diabetes mellitus. Subclinical hypothyroid subjects must be frequently screened for hypertension. Of 120 individuals with hypertension, 45 (37.5%) were also diagnosed with diabetes. This co-occurrence was significantly higher in subjects aged over 50 years (26.7%), in the lower socio-economic class (18.5%), and among those who were married (14.7%).

TB should be ruled out first before attributing polyserositis to any other cause like hypothyroidism, particularly in high TB burden countries.
Polyserositis has numerous causes and frequently occurs in neoplasia, autoimmune disorders, endocrine conditions like hypothyroidism, and infectious diseases like tuberculosis (TB). The diagnosis of TB polyserositis is complex and challenging, which may cause the start of definitive therapy to be delayed. Here, we report the case of a 32-year-old female patient who presented with abdominal distension for 3 weeks associated with shortness of breath, cough, excessive fatigue, and loss of appetite. Thyroid function tests were suggestive of primary hypothyroidism, and later on, sputum GeneXpert MTB/RIF test turned out to be positive. She was initially started on oral levothyroxine and then anti-TB medications. The polyserositis resolved a month after the initiation of anti-TB drugs. TB should be ruled out first before attributing polyserositis to any other cause like hypothyroidism, particularly in high TB burden countries. Microbiologic tests, such as GeneXpert, remain the most important tools to make a diagnosis of TB and start anti-TB medications early."

This article illustrates the clinical characteristics of hypothyroidism induced by PD-1 antibodies (Abs) and reports the recommended replacement dosage for hypothyroidism.
Eighteen patients with overt primary hypothyroidism induced by PD-1 Abs (group 1) were selected from 655 patients with different tumor types. Retrospective analysis was performed on patients in group 1 and 18 patients with natural courses of overt primary hypothyroidism who were age- and sex-matched with the patients in group 1 (group 2). The replacement dosages required for the patients in the two groups were compared.
Thyroid dysfunction occurred in group 1 after approximately 3.0±1.4 cycles of PD-1 therapy (1-6 stages), with a median time of 61.5 days. The median time of onset of hypothyroidism among all patients was 87.5 days (30-240 days). Most of the patients with hypothyroidism were asymptomatic, and the onset of hypothyroidism was independent of age, sex, TPOAb, TgAb and TSH in group 1 (P>0.05). The average replacement dosage for patients in group 1 was 1.80.6 µg/kg/d (0.6-3.2 µg/kg/d). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that sex, age, TPOAb, TgAb and TSH were not correlated with drug dosage.
It seemed that the average maintenance dosage of levothyroxine might need to be 1.8 µg/kg/day for patients with overt hypothyroidism induced by PD-1 Abs."

This study aimed to evaluate levels of drug adherence (DA) to levothyroxine therapy among Omani adults with hypothyroidism and to explore related sociodemographic and clinical factors.
A national, multi-center, cross-sectional survey was carried out from August to December 2021 at 18 primary healthcare centers across all governorates of Oman. A total of 415 Omani adults were recruited. Data were collected using a pre-tested, Arabic-language questionnaire completed by trained researchers during face-to-face interviews with the participants. Level of DA was determined using the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8).
A total of 400 Omani adults participated in the study (response rate: 96.4%). The mean age was 41.9 ± 12.4 years old (range: 18-78 years) and 90.3% were female. According to their MMAS-8 scores, 157 (39.2%), 139 (34.8%), and 104 (26.0%) participants demonstrated low, medium, and high DA, respectively. No significant correlations were observed between level of DA and any sociodemographic or clinical characteristics, including age, gender, education, duration of treatment, and family history of thyroid disease (
Only a quarter of Omani patients with hypothyroidism reported high levels of adherence to levothyroxine treatment, likely as a result of lack of awareness of the disease and the importance of maintaining an euthyroid state.

Hypothyroidism-related myopathy is a well-known entity. However, systemic effects of acute myopathies, such as rhabdomyolysis, on thyroid hormone metabolism have not to date been fully clarified.
Fifty-three earthquake victims were evaluated retrospectively. We investigated the thyroid function tests (TFTs) among patients with creatine kinase (CK) levels higher than 10.000 U/L at admission. Fifteen patients had CK levels higher than 10.000 U/L and 12 of them had data of TFTs, including thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free T4 (FT4), and free T3 (FT3) during hospitalization. These patients were evaluated.
TSH levels were increased in all seven patients who required HD due to severe crush syndrome. Decreased FT4 levels were detected in 71.4% of them. None of the five non-HD patients had increased TSH levels or reduced FT4 levels. During follow-up, all patients survived. Renal and thyroid functions were normalized during follow-up without thyroxin replacement in patients with no prior history of hypothyroidism. Moreover, TFTs were normalized in two patients with history of hypothyroidism under thyroxine treatment without dose adjustments.

Emerging evidence suggests the protective effects of vitamin D against liver damage. Herein, this study aimed to investigate the role of vitamin D in hypothyroidism-associated liver injury. Forty male Wistar rats were classified into 4 groups: control, hypothyroid (Hypo) group received 0.05% PTU, Hypo- Vitamin D groups were given 100 and 500 IU/kg vitamin D orally via gavage for 6 weeks. Serum level of liver function including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity, and total thiol content were measured as oxidative stress indicators in the liver tissue. Furthermore, to estimate liver tissue fibrosis, Masson's trichrome staining was done. Our findings showed that hypothyroidism-induced liver fibrosis was associated with increased levels of ALT, AST and ALP. Though, vitamin D administration could significantly reduce the ALT, AST and ALP in the serum and suppress the accumulation of collagen fibers. Moreover, the activity of SOD and total thiol content was notably reduced, while the MDA content was significantly increased in the PTU- induced hypothyroid rats compared to the control group. Nonetheless, treatment with vitamin D improved mentioned oxidative stress markers in the Hypo-vitamin D groups. In conclusion, vitamin D due to its potential antioxidant and anti-fibrotic properties could be effective in the decrease of hypothyroidism-associated liver injury."

Herein, we established the model of SCH in the aged female mice. This study was designed to investigate whether human amnion-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMSC) could effect on immune regulation, apoptosis inhibition of thyroid cells, thyroid function, blood lipid levels, and heart function. In addition, qualified hAMSCs were intravenously injected into aged female SCH mice via the tail vein on day 0 and day 10. The levels of thyroid hormone and blood lipids as well as cardiac function, serum immunological indexes, and apoptosis of thyroid cells were then analyzed on day 5, 10, 15, and 20; meanwhile, the quantity of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg immune cells in peripheral blood was evaluated before and on day 20 post-injection. Our study demonstrated that after hAMSC transplantation, the thyroid functions, blood lipid levels, and heart function indexes of age-related SCH (AR-SCH) mice were significantly improved. Consistent with this, Th1 and Treg cells increased significantly, while Th2 and Th17 cells decreased in peripheral blood. Apoptosis was also suppressed in the thyroid cells. In summary, hAMSC delivery can potentially be a safe and effective therapy for treating SCH in the elderly, improving related complications by immunomodulatory and apoptosis inhibition."

Her physical examination was pertinent for mild lower extremity edema, easy bruising, and skin thinning. Workup revealed adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-independent MACS from bilateral micronodular hyperplasia of the adrenals. Since she was not a surgical candidate, medical management with mifepristone was chosen. While on mifepristone, she complained of excessive fatigue, a workup done revealed new-onset hypothyroidism. Given her symptoms and bloodwork, she was started on levothyroxine. After stopping mifepristone, she was biochemically and clinically euthyroid and was eventually off levothyroxine.

Narrative review of the literature.
Hypothyroidism is globally very prevalent at all age groups and represents a non-communicable disease in which the risks and consequences are preventable. In children and adolescents, the most devastating consequences of undertreatment are poor growth and development. Lack of early treatment in congenital hypothyroidism can lead to permanent damage of brain function. In young to middle-aged adults, consequences are often overlooked, and treatment delayed by many years. The resulting consequences are also at this age group compromised brain and physical functioning but less severe and partly reversible with treatment. The undertreated condition often results in a higher risk of several secondary devastating diseases such as increased cardiovascular disease burden, obesity, hypertension, poor physical capacity, poor quality of life. In young women of fertile age the consequences of undertreatment with LT4 are subnormal fertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, compromised fetal growth and neurocognitive development. There is a further risk of 30-50% of developing postpartum thyroiditis. In the elderly population care must be given to avoid confusing a slightly high serum TSH as result of physiological age adaptation with a requirement for LT4 treatment in a truly hypothyroid patient.
Undertreatment of the preventable non-communicable disease hypothyroidism requires more focus both from caretakers in the healthcare system, but also from the global political systems in order to prevent the personally devastating and socioeconomically challenging consequences."

A serum TSH level of 6.8 mIU/L is presented as the reference value for diagnosing SCH. SCH can be classified as mild (TSH 6.8 to 10.0 mIU/L) or severe (TSH >10.0 mIU/L), and patients can be categorized as adults (age <70 years) or elderly (age ≥70 years), depending on the health effects of LT4 treatment. An initial increase in serum TSH levels should be reassessed with a subsequent measurement, including a thyroid peroxidase antibody test, preferably 2 to 3 months after the initial assessment. While LT4 treatment is not generally recommended for mild SCH in adults, it is necessary for severe SCH in patients with underlying coronary artery disease or heart failure and it may be considered for those with concurrent dyslipidemia. Conversely, LT4 treatment is generally not recommended for elderly patients, regardless of SCH severity. For those SCH patients who are prescribed LT4 treatment, the dosage should be personalized, and serum TSH levels should be regularly monitored to maintain the optimal LT4 regimen."

Faculty members were also more likely to consider patient preference for treatment (60.0% vs 32.3%, P < .001). Among all respondents, the clinical factors that resulted in the highest predicted probability of treatment were hypothyroid symptoms (predicted probability [PP] 68.8%, 95% CI [65.7%-71.9%]), thyroid stimulating hormone >10 mIU/L in a 31-year-old (PP 63.9%, 95% CI [60.3%-67.3%]), and the desire for fertility (PP 52.2%, 95% CI [48.6%-56.0%]). In general, faculty members favored more aggressive treatment across all clinical scenarios.
The presence of symptoms, thyroid stimulating hormone >10 mIU/L, and desire for fertility were most predictive of the decision to treat in SCH. In several clinical scenarios, both trainee and faculty decision-making demonstrated discordance with general SCH management principles."

Hence, the present review aimed to clarify the potential association between HPT and AD. HPT promotes the progression of AD by inducing the production of amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau protein phosphorylation with the development of synaptic plasticity and memory dysfunction. Besides, the metabolism of THs is dysregulated in AD due to the accumulation of Aβ and tau protein phosphorylation leading to local brain HPT. Additionally, HPT can affect AD neuropathology through various mechanistic pathways including dysregulation of transthyretin, oxidative stress, ER stress, autophagy dysfunction mitochondrial dysfunction, and inhibition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Taken together there is a potential link between HPT and AD, as HPT adversely impacts AD neuropathology and the reverse is also true."

The participants reached consensus on five of the 26 practice statements that (a) repeated testing was required for the diagnosis of subclinical hypothyroidism, (b) antibody screening should usually occur, and (c and d) antibody screening would strengthen the indication for thyroid hormone replacement therapy in both individuals with or without affective disorder or anxiety. The participants disagreed with (e) a requirement of a TSH threshold ≥ 20 mIU/L for thyroid hormone replacement therapy start. Psychiatrists and GPs but not endocrinologists, agreed that there was a frequent discrepancy between laboratory results and clinical symptoms, and disagreed that testing for thyroid dysfunction was overused in patients presenting with depression or anxiety, or fatigue.
In many aspects, attitudes toward diagnosing and treating SCH remain diverse. The inability of our Delphi panel to achieve consensus on most items and the disagreement with a TSH ≥ 20 mIU/L threshold for treatment suggest that the concept of SCH may need rethinking with a better understanding of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid physiology.

A significant relationship was not found between provincial growth rates in screening coverage and provincial baseline incidences of CH.  Conclusion: CH incidence has substantially increased in China. The slight adjustment of the TSH cutoff value and increasing preterm birth rate contribute to such a trend; however, the contribution is limited. What is Known: • An uptrend in congenital hypothyroidism (CH) incidence has been reported in many European and American countries in the last two decades; however, no studies have been conducted in China to explain the increased CH incidence. • We provide a detailed epidemiological report on the trends of CH during 2012-2019 in China, with an attempt to explore the reasons behind it. What is New: • This first-ever national-wide epidemiological report in China showed an uptrend in CH incidence with variations over regions and CH subtypes. The mild lowering of TSH cutoff values and the increasing preterm birth rate contributed to this uptrend."

The key factor for a good clinical outcome for hypothyroidism is medication adherence, as the mainstay treatment of hypothyroidism is lifelong hormonal replacement therapy, Levothyroxine (LT4). Poor adherence to LT4 is not only linked to great healthcare costs but also to significant economic burdens.
The aim of this study is to assess the medication adherence of patients on LT4 treatment in the Madinah region and its association with socio-demographic characteristics, participants' experience with hypothyroidism and taking LT4, and Morisky Medication Adherence Scale 8-Item (MMAS-8).
A cross-sectional study was conducted on 420 hypothyroidism patients on LT4 for at least three months in the Madinah region using a self-administered electronic form. The variables in the questionnaire included socio-demographic characteristics, participants' experience with hypothyroidism and taking LT4, and MMAS-8.
This study included a total of 420 patients with 81% being females, 52.1% aged 40 years and above, and 91% living in Madinah City. The study shows an overall poor adherence rate toward taking LT4, where the vast majority, 66.7% of the participants, had a low adherence level toward taking LT4, 23.3% had a moderate adherence level, and only 10% had a high adherence level.

According to the diagnostic criteria of thyroid diseases, the subjects were divided into a normal thyroid function group and a subclinical hypothyroidism group. Both groups received a physical examination, and blood samples were collected. The measurement indexes included FPG, FINS, OGTT2hPG, OGTT2hINS, HbA1c, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, TSH, FT3 and FT4. HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, and TFQI (thyroid feedback quantile index) were calculated.
There was no significant difference in age or sex distribution between the T2DM group and the normoglycemic group (P>0.05). The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in the T2DM group was significantly higher than that in the normoglycemic group (16.39% vs. 11.27%, P<0.05), and among the different types of thyroid dysfunction, the prevalence of SCH was the highest at 14.95% (P<0.05).

Memory deficits and, the most recently described, circadian rhythm disruption are among the impairments caused by thyroid dysfunctions. However, although highly likely, there is no evidence connecting these two effects of hypothyroidism. Here, we hypothesized the time-of-day interferes with the memory deficit caused by hypothyroidism. C57BL/6 J mice from both sexes were subjected to novel object recognition (NOR) task during the rest and active phases, corresponding to ZT 2-4 and 14-16, respectively (ZT: Zeitgeber time; ZT 0: lights on at 07:00 am). First, we showed that neither sex nor ZT altered object recognition memory (ORM) in euthyroid mice. Next, animals were divided into control (euthyroid) and hypothyroid [induced with methimazole (0.01%) and perchlorate (0.1%) treatment in the drinking water for 21 days] groups. Under euthyroid conditions, male and female mice recognized the novel object regardless of the time-of-day. However, hypothyroidism impaired ORM at rest phase (ZT 2-4) in both sexes. Surprisingly, in the active phase (ZT 14-16), the hypothyroid males performed the NOR, though a longer time to execute the task was required. In contrast, female hypothyroid mice showed a greater impairment in ORM. Our results suggest that hypothyroidism may disrupt the circadian rhythm in brain areas related to mnemonic processes since in euthyroid condition ORM is not affected by the time-of-day. Furthermore, our findings in an animal model indicate a pronounced deleterious effect of hypothyroidism in women."

The thyroid gland is another vital cog in the wheel of the endocrine system, and the hormones synthesized by it are heavily involved in the control of the body's metabolism. Hypothyroidism is a state in which thyroid hormones are deficient due to various factors and is characterized by a metabolically hypoactive state. Together, insulin, implicated in DM, and thyroid hormones engage in an intricate dance and serve to regulate the body's metabolism. It is imperative to explore the relationship between these two common endocrine disorders to understand their clinical association and mold treatments specific to patients in which they coexist. Both type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have been shown to have an increased association with hypothyroidism, especially in patients with risk factors including female sex, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and anemia.

Therefore, a prospective study was designed to investigate the potential alterations in the measurement of thyroid hormone concentrations and clinical consequences in patients with hypothyroidism using low -dose BCS containing less than 300 μg/day.
Fifty-seven patients on thyroxine supplementation, as a result of hypothyroidism and concurrent use of BCS at a dose <300μg/day for 10 to 60 days were prospectively evaluated. Namely, TSH and free T4 (FT4) concentration measurements were performed, during BC supplementation and 10 days post BCS discontinuation and compared to 31 age-matched patients with supplemented hypothyroidism and without BCS.
A statistically significant increase in TSH and decline in FT4 concentrations was observed after BCS discontinuation. However, on clinical grounds, these modifications were minor and led to medication dose adjustment in only 2/57 patients (3.51%) in whom TSH was notably decreased after supplement discontinuation.
Our study suggests that changes in thyroid hormones profiling, due to supplements containing low dose biotin, are of minimal clinical relevance and in most cases don't occult the need to adjust the thyroxine replacement dose in patients with hypothyroidism.

After a few months, this eliminates the signs and symptoms of overt hypothyroidism in the majority of patients, owing to the endogenous activation of thyroxine to triiodothyronine, the biologically active thyroid hormone. Still, a small percentage of the patients (10%-20%) exhibit residual symptoms, despite having normal serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. These symptoms include cognitive, mood, and metabolic deficits, with a significant impairment in psychological well-being and quality of life.
To provide a summary of progress in the approach of patients with hypothyroidism that exhibit residual symptoms despite treatment.
We reviewed the current literature and here we focused on the mechanisms leading to a deficiency of T3 in some LT4-treated patients, the role of residual thyroid tissue and the rationale for combination therapy with LT4 + liothyronine (LT3).
A score of clinical trials comparing therapy with LT4 versus LT4 + LT3 concluded that both are safe and equally effective (neither is superior); however, these trials failed to recruit a sufficiently large number of patients with residual symptoms. New clinical trials that considered LT4-treated symptomatic patients revealed that such patients benefit from and prefer therapy containing LT4 + LT3; desiccated thyroid extract has also been used with similar results. A practical approach to patients with residual symptoms and on initiation of combination therapy with LT4 + LT3 is provided.
A recent joint statement of the American, British, and European Thyroid Associations recommends that a trial with combination therapy be offered to patients with hypothyroidism that do not fully benefit from therapy with LT4."

Accurate identification of patients with symptomatic (almost exclusively overt) hypothyroidism is important in evaluating clinical outcomes of therapies. Recent studies have documented that nearly a third of individuals who are offered thyroid hormone are euthyroid at the time of initiation. Additionally, others are clinically diagnosed without biochemical confirmation, so a sizable proportion of those started on LT4 are not hypothyroid. The assumption that nonhypothyroid symptoms will resolve with LT4 is problematic. The true underlying cause of these symptoms remains unidentified and untreated.
In a narrative fashion I will review the positive predictive value of and correlation of symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism and confirmed hypothyroidism likely to favorably respond to thyroid hormone replacement.
Following a review of the reliability of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in predicting a euthyroid state, the correlation of circulating triiodothyronine (serum measurement) (T3) levels with symptoms and predictive value of T3 to forecast the outcome of adding LT3 to LT4 will be reviewed. The utility of striving for high, middle, or low TSH set points within the expected range to predict changes in clinical quality of life and the ability of blinded patients to sense subtle differences along this spectrum will be documented. In addition, the clinical impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the type 2 deiodinase gene will be reviewed. Finally, the overall satisfaction of selected patients with their thyroid hormone treatments will be outlined and preferences for T3-containing treatments from blinded studies will be summarized.
Basing thyroid hormone treatment decisions on patient symptoms likely results in missed diagnoses We should encourage primary care physicians to assess a differential diagnosis, exclude other diagnoses, and not assume a thyroid etiology when TSH is normal. Modifying treatment to a particular TSH target or adjusting based on a low T3 level does not seem to enhance patient outcomes. Finally, pending further trials of ""symptomatic"" participants, using sustained release LT3 to mimic normal physiology, and including monocarboxylate 10 transporter and Type 2 deiodinase polymorphisms and objective outcomes, I will continue to depend on therapy with LT4 monotherapy and seek alternative explanations for my patients' nonspecific symptoms."

Also, hypothyroidism and /or exposure to IR markedly enhance the endoplasmic reticulum stress by upregulating the gene expressions of the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), activated transcription factor 6 (ATF6), endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) in the brain tissue homogenate associated with a proapoptotic state which indicated by the overexpression of Bax, BCl2, and caspase-12 that culminates in brain damage. Meanwhile, the PTU and /or IR-exposed rats treated with MEE reduced oxidative stress and ERAD through ATF6. Also, the MEE treatment prevented the Bax and caspase-12 gene expression from increasing. This treatment in hypothyroid animals was associated with neuronal protection as indicated by the downregulation in the gene expressions of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) and amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain tissue. Furthermore, the administration of MEE ameliorates the histological structure of brain tissue. In conclusion, MEE might prevent hypothyroidism-induced brain damage associated with oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress."

The WCE is usually temporary, and the thyroid gland adjusts to high iodine levels within days or weeks. It is a protective mechanism and a failure to escape from it can result in thyroid dysfunction. Hypothyroidism is rare but more likely in patients who have had thyroid disease, are under stress, or are exposed to high iodine concentrations for a long time. The use of iodinated contrast media in radiologic studies or invasive medical procedures is a common source of excessive iodine exposure and can lead to thyroid disfunction. Despite the frequent use of contrast media in health care, the thyroid dysfunction associated with their use is poorly recognized. We report a patient who developed iodine-induced hypothyroidism after chemoembolization of recurrent chylothorax with ethiodized oil (Lipiodol®, Villepinte, France).

In this study, we explored the metabolic changes in the plasma of patients with hypothyroidism after reaching a euthyroid state with levothyroxine treatment.
Plasma samples from 18 patients diagnosed as overt hypothyroidism were collected before and after levothyroxine treatment upon reaching a euthyroid state and were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Multivariate and univariate analyses evaluated data to highlight potential metabolic biomarkers.
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics revealed a significant decrease in the levels of ceramide, phosphatidylcholine, triglycerides, acylcarnitine, and peptides after levothyroxine treatment; this could indicate a change in the fatty acid transportation system and an enhanced β-oxidation, compared with a hypothyroid state. At the same time, the decrease in the peptides suggested a shift in protein synthesis. In addition, there was a considerable rise in glycocholic acid following therapy, suggesting the involvement of thyroid hormones in stimulating bile acid production and secretion.
A metabolomic analysis of patients with hypothyroidism revealed significant changes in several metabolites and lipids after treatment. This study showed the value of the metabolomics technique in providing a complementary understanding of the pathophysiology of hypothyroidism and as a crucial tool for examining the molecular impact of levothyroxine treatment on hypothyroidism.

We utilized a nationwide database to conduct a longitudinal analysis of 919,707 children. Children's exposure to CH was identified using claims-based data. The primary outcome of interest was suspected neurodevelopmental disorder, which was measured using the Korean Ages & Stages Questionnaires (K-ASQ) administered annually from 9-72 months of age. Secondary outcomes were height and BMI z-scores. After randomly matching cases and controls at a 1:10 ratio, we employed inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) and generalized estimating equation (GEE) models for our analyses. We conducted subgroup analysis based on the age of treatment initiation.
The prevalence of CH in our population was 0.05% (n = 408). Relative to the control group, the CH group had a higher risk of suspected neurodevelopmental disorders (propensity score [PS] -weighted odds ratio: 4.52, 95% CI: 2.91, 7.02), and significantly increased risk in each of the five K-ASQ domains. No time interactions were noted at any rounds for the outcomes according to when the neurodevelopmental assessment was conducted (all P for interaction >0.05). The CH group also had a higher risk for low height-for-age z-score, but not for elevated BMI-for-age z-score.

BDE209 is neurotoxic, possibly related to its interference with the thyroid hormone (TH) system. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of BDE209-induced TH interference and neurobehavioral disorders remains unknown. Here, we explored how BDE209 manipulated the major enzyme, human type II iodothyronine deiodinase (Dio2), that is most important in regulating local cerebral TH equilibrium by neuroglial cells, using an in vitro model of human glioma H4 cells. Clonogenic cell survival assay and LC/MS/MS analysis showed that BDE209 could induce chronic neurotoxicity by inducing TH interference. Co-IP assay, RT-qPCR and confocal assay identified that BDE209 destroyed the stability of Dio2 without affecting its expression, and promoted its binding to p62, thereby enhancing its autophagic degradation, thus causing TH metabolism disorder and neurotoxicity. Furthermore, molecular docking studies predicted that BDE209 could effectively suppress Dio2 activity by competing with tetraiodothyronine (T4). Collectively, our study demonstrates that BDE209-induced Dio2 degradation and loss of its enzymatic activity in neuroglial cells are the fundamental pathogenic basis for BDE209-mediated cerebral TH disequilibrium and neurotoxicity, providing a target of interest for further investigation using glial/neuronal cell co-culture system and in vivo models."

Detection of TH deficiency early in life by neonatal screening allows early treatment, thereby preventing brain damage. Inborn shortage of TH, also named congenital hypothyroidism (CH), can be the result of defective thyroid gland development or TH synthesis (primary or thyroidal CH (CH-T)). Primary CH is characterized by low blood TH and elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations. Less frequently, CH is due to insufficient stimulation of the thyroid gland because of disturbed hypothalamic or pituitary function (central CH). Central CH is characterized by low TH concentrations, while TSH is normal, low or slightly elevated. Most newborn screening (NBS) programs for CH are primarily TSH based and thereby do not detect central CH. Only a few NBS programs worldwide aim to detect both forms of CH by different strategies. In the Netherlands, we have a unique T4-TSH-thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) NBS algorithm for CH, which enables the detection of primary and central CH. Although the necessity of central CH detection by NBS is still under debate, it has been shown that most central CH patients have moderate-to-severe hypothyroidism instead of mild and that early detection of central CH by NBS probably improves its clinical outcome and clinical care for central CH patients with multiple pituitary hormone deficiency. We are therefore convinced that detection of central CH by NBS is of utmost importance."

Despite more than 20 years of debate, the use of liothyronine for this indication remains controversial, as numerous randomised trials have failed to show a benefit of treatment regimens that combine liothyronine (T3) with levothyroxine over levothyroxine monotherapy. This consensus statement attempts to provide practical guidance to clinicians faced with patients who have persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement therapy. It applies to non-pregnant adults and is focussed on care delivered within the UK National Health Service, although it may be relevant in other healthcare environments. The statement emphasises several key clinical practice points for patients dissatisfied with treatment for hypothyroidism. Firstly, it is important to establish a diagnosis of overt hypothyroidism; patients with persistent symptoms during thyroid hormone replacement but with no clear biochemical evidence of overt hypothyroidism should first have a trial without thyroid hormone replacement. In those with established overt hypothyroidism, levothyroxine doses should be optimised aiming for a TSH in the 0.3-2.0 mU/L range for 3 to 6 months before a therapeutic response can be assessed. In some patients, it may be acceptable to have serum TSH below reference range (e.g. 0.1-0.3 mU/L), but not fully suppressed in the long term. We suggest that for some patients with confirmed overt hypothyroidism and persistent symptoms who have had adequate treatment with levothyroxine and in whom other comorbidities have been excluded, a trial of liothyronine/levothyroxine combined therapy may be warranted. The decision to start treatment with liothyronine should be a shared decision between patient and clinician. However, individual clinicians should not feel obliged to start liothyronine or to continue liothyronine medication provided by other health care practitioners or accessed without medical advice, if they judge this not to be in the patient's best interest."

216,37256446,2023-05-31,Acquired Hypothyroidism in Children.,"Acquired hypothyroidism"", ""Hashimoto thyroiditis","Acquired hypothyroidism is generally also referred to as juvenile hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is due to the deficient secretion of thyroid hormones causing metabolic and neurological sequelae at the cellular level. It can present as overt hypothyroidism wherein the thyroid hormones (T4 and T3) secretion fall and thyrotropin (TSH) rises. Acquired hypothyroidism frequently presents between 9 and 11 y of age and is rarely seen before 4 y of age. Approximately 80% of the children and adolescents are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Children with moderate to severe hypothyroidism often present for evaluation of poor growth, constipation, lethargy and/or dry skin. A detailed history and examination will provide us with enough clues for diagnosing hypothyroidism. Primary hypothyroidism can be diagnosed with raised TSH with subnormal levels of T3 and T4. Titres of thyroid antibodies - Anti-thyroperoxidase (TPO) and anti-thyroglobulin (ATG) antibodies, will be high in autoimmune hypothyroidism. Subclinical hypothyroidism is diagnosed with mildly elevated or high normal levels of TSH with free T4 being in the normal range. Insufficient secretion of thyrotropin from the pituitary causes central hypothyroidism. Acquired hypothyroidism is treated by replacement with levothyroxine. Regular monitoring of thyroid profile is necessary for adjusting doses of levothyroxine. Close monitoring and individualization of levothyroxine therapy is essential for normal growth and development of the child."

Blood samples were collected from the participants to assess their lipid profile and TSH levels.  Results The study showed a statistically significant difference between the mean TSH levels of hypothyroid pregnant females in the 2nd trimester (3.85 ± 0.59) and the 3rd trimester (4.71 ± 0.54). There was a significant positive correlation observed between TSH and Total Cholesterol, Triglycerides, and LDL-C in both the 2nd and 3rd trimesters. In the second trimester, there was a significant positive correlation observed between TSH & TC (r = 0.6634, p<0.0005), TSH & TG (r= 0.7346, p=0.00006), TSH & LDL (r= 0.5322, p= 0.008). In the third trimester, there was a significant positive correlation observed between TSH & TC (r = 0.8929, p<0.00001), TSH & TG (r= 0.430, p<0.00001), TSH & LDL (r= 0.168, p= 0.015). However, no significant correlation was found between TSH levels and HDL-C in either trimester. The correlation coefficient and p-value for TSH & HDL were r = 0.2083, p=0.340 in the second trimester, and r = 0.0189, p=0.2384 in the third trimester. Conclusion A significant increase in TSH levels in hypothyroid pregnant women was observed in the 3rd trimester compared to the second trimester. Moreover, a significant positive correlation was found between TSH and lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL) in both trimesters, but not with HDL. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring thyroid hormone levels in the later stages of pregnancy to avoid potential maternal & fetal complications."

According to the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health (MOH), many thyroid disease cases remain undiagnosed and, as a result, are not treated because the patient has no symptoms or is unaware of them. Hence, this study aims to assess the knowledge about hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism among Saudi Arabia's population. Methodology A cross-sectional survey was conducted among Saudi adults in five randomly selected regions in Saudi Arabia from December 2022 - January 2023. An Arabic self-administered questionnaire was sent to randomly selected participants via an online link. The questionnaire was composed of four parts: Sociodemographic; knowledge related to hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism diseases and their differences; knowledge about the thyroid gland in terms of functions and causes of thyroid dysfunction. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences was used for data analysis. Results Out of 996 participants (66.2% women), 70.1% knew the function of the thyroid gland, 66.4% knew that women are more susceptible to thyroid disease, and 49.5% knew the association between thyroid dysfunction and heart disease. Female sex, higher education, and old age were associated with good knowledge, and no differences were evident regarding nationality and residence. The results showed inadequate awareness regarding thyroid diseases in Saudi Arabia, with some parts of this population being very clearly below average. Conclusion Knowledge regarding thyroid disorders was sub-optimal in Saudi Arabia; older women with higher education had the best knowledge. With even larger samples, we recommend that future studies be made to develop clear and decisive public health strategies that can be implemented at once."

The negative effects of hypothyroidism on patients' quality of life (QoL) are well-documented. It is said to be common in the countries of the Arabian Gulf, although it is often misdiagnosed and treated in an inconsistent manner. Hence, understanding how an illness like this affects a patient's life might help us enhance their QoL and get us closer to the healthcare transformation goals of Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030. Methodology This cross-sectional study was conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, between June 2022 and February 2023. A convenience non-probability sampling method was used. The WHO Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-BREF questionnaire in Arabic was used to compile the data. Data were collected using a standardized form, refined using Google Forms, and then documented in an Excel spreadsheet. The descriptive statistics were shown as means and standard deviations (SD). To assess the numerical data, a t-test was used, while the chi-square test was employed to examine the relationship between the qualitative factors. Results A total of 394 adults from the general population with hypothyroidism were surveyed, including 105 men and 289 women. Of them, 151 (38.3%) patients had not sought therapy for their hypothyroidism, while 243 (61.7%) patients had. When asked about the QoL, a significant segment (37.6%) of patients reported that it was high, and 29.7% reported being totally satisfied with their health. The WHOQOL-BREF domain scores revealed that environmental health had the highest value (24.04 ±4.62), followed by physical health (22.24 ±3.23), and then psychological health (18.08 ±2.82), and the lowest scores were reported for the rate of QoL and satisfaction with health (2.64 ±1.36 and 2.80 ±1.68), respectively. Each domain of the WHOQOL-BREF had its own set of variables that differed from one another in a statistically significant manner (p<0.001). Conclusions  Based on our findings, we recommend expert physician monitoring and implementing educational programs as well as placing a greater emphasis on patients' QoL in the management of hypothyroidism."

Of 82,514 U.S. women aged 50-79 years enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative, 2,303 self-reported being born preterm. Logistic regression was used to analyze the prevalence of each condition at enrollment with birth status (preterm, full term). Multinomial logistic regression models analyzed the association between birth status and each condition alone and concurrently. Outcome variables using the 3 conditions were created to give 8 categories ranging from no disease, each condition alone, two-way combinations, to having all three conditions. The models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, and sociodemographic, lifestyle, and other health-related risk factors. Women born preterm were significantly more likely to have any one or a combination of the selected conditions. In fully adjusted models for individual conditions, the adjusted odds ratios (aORs) were 1.14 (95% CI, 1.04, 1.26) for hypertension, 1.28 (1.12, 1.47) for RA, and 1.12 (1.01, 1.24) for hypothyroidism.

However, both ICIs and antiangiogenic agents are associated with endocrine dysfunctions, mainly hypothyroidism. The risk of hypothyroidism is potentially increased with the combination of ICIs and antiangiogenic agents. This study aimed to investigate the incidence and risk factors of hypothyroidism in patients receiving combination therapy.
We performed a retrospective cohort study of advanced NSCLC patients treated with ICIs and antiangiogenic agents at Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute & Hospital from July 1, 2019, to December 31, 2021. Patients with normal thyroid function at baseline were enrolled, and information on the patients' characteristics before receiving combination therapy, including body mass index (BMI) and laboratory data, was obtained.
Among the 137 enrolled patients, 39 (28.5%) developed new-onset hypothyroidism, and 20 (14.6%) developed overt hypothyroidism. The incidence of hypothyroidism was significantly higher in obese patients than in patients with a low to normal BMI (P<0.001). Obese patients also had a higher incidence of overt hypothyroidism (P=0.016). Univariate logistic regression showed that BMI as a continuous variable was a significant risk factor for hypothyroidism [odds ratio (OR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10-1.42, P<0.001] and overt hypothyroidism (OR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.01-1.38, P=0.039). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that only BMI (OR 1.36, 95% CI: 1.16-1.61, P<0.001) and age (OR 1.08, 95% CI: 1.02-1.14, P=0.006) were significant risk factors for treatment-related hypothyroidism.
The risk of hypothyroidism in patients receiving a combination of ICIs and antiangiogenic therapy is manageable, and a higher BMI is associated with a significantly increased risk of hypothyroidism. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the development of hypothyroidism in obese advanced NSCLC patients during the administration of ICIs combined with antiangiogenic agents."

However, a paradoxical occurrence of peripheral precocious puberty and pituitary enlargement in chronically untreated juvenile hypothyroidism was first reported by Van Wyk and Grumbach in 1960.
To create increased awareness and a better understanding of this clinical entity among emergency room physicians, pediatricians, surgeons, gynecologists and oncologists.
Case records of children diagnosed with Van Wyk-Grumbach syndrome (VWGS) were analyzed retrospectively.
Twenty-six girls and 4 boys were identified (2005-2020). All had profound primary hypothyroidism (total thyroxine [T4]: 2.5-33.5 nmol/L, thyrotropin: > 75-3744 μIU/mL). Hypothyroidism was not the referral diagnosis in any of the girls. Among them, 17 were referred for precocious puberty, 5 with a diagnosis of pituitary tumor on magnetic resonance imaging, and others for acute surgical abdomen in 7 girls (painful abdominal mass-2, ovarian tumor-2, ovarian torsion-2, ruptured ovarian cyst-1), acute myelopathy in 1, and menorrhagia with headache in another. All girls were successfully managed with levothyroxine replacement alone, except for the 2 with ovarian torsion, who required surgery. Menstruation ceased promptly with T4 therapy in all girls, occurring at an age-appropriate later date. All boys had testicular enlargement at presentation that regressed partially after T4 treatment. Catch-up growth was remarkable during the first treatment year, but the final height was compromised in all.
Increased awareness of varied presentations of VWGS is vital among pediatricians to facilitate early diagnosis and targeted investigations, and to help in the initiation of the simple yet highly rewarding T4 replacement therapy to avoid all possible complications."

We report the case of a 13-year-old male, who was admitted to the hospital due to swelling of the torso and neck. Besides these symptoms, the child was healthy, except for a significant growth delay. Ultrasound evaluation and blood tests led to the diagnosis of myxedema secondary to severe hypothyroidism, which was due to autoimmune thyroiditis. Further investigations revealed pericardial effusion and pituitary hyperplasia, with hyper-prolactinemia. Treatment with levothyroxine led to edema regression and clinical, hemato-chemical and radiological improvement. After 6 months, growth velocity increased, although the recovery of growth already lost was not guaranteed. Brain MRI showed regression of pituitary hyperplasia. The diagnostic delay in this case was probably due to the patient's apparent good health, and the underestimation of growth restriction. This report underlines the importance of growth monitoring in adolescence, a critical period for identifying endocrine conditions; if undiagnosed, these conditions can lead to serious complications, such as myxedema in hypothyroidism, with potential effects beyond growth on multiple organs."

The symptom triad consisting of cognitive impairment, cold intolerance, and sexual dysfunction is more strongly suggestive of hypothyroidism than of any other diagnoses proposed in the medical literature so far.

We aimed to compare the clinical course and biochemical parameters of two subtypes of ICI-related destructive thyroiditis: a transient thyrotoxicosis that reverts to either euthyroidism (TT; transient thyroiditis) versus progression to permanent hypothyroidism (PH), and to identify prognostic markers in cancer patients receiving ICI therapy who developed DT.
This retrospective observational study included 124 patients who developed a transient thyrotoxicosis due to a destructive thyroiditis after ICI therapy from January 1, 2016 to April 30, 2021 at the Montefiore Medical Center. Patients were categorized as either TT or PH based on spontaneous renormalization of the TSH or the permanent need for thyroid hormone replacement, respectively. Thyroid hormone and antibody levels, serum inflammatory markers, eosinophils, and metabolic uptake of the thyroid on PET imaging, each corresponding closest to a suppressed TSH, were characterized. Survival from TT and PH were also analyzed.
Of the 124 patients, 53 developed PH and 71 developed TT. The PH group developed thyrotoxicosis at a median of 42 days from the first ICI dose while the TT group took significantly longer at 56 days. Thyroidal PET uptake was increased in 18.9% of the PH group versus 6.0% of the TT group (P=0.04). Three different survival models consistently demonstrated a trend towards increased survival in the PH group, compared to the TT group.
Our results suggest that PH developing after ICI-induced destructive thyroiditis may be associated with a more robust inflammatory and antitumor response to ICI therapy. The results suggests that PH may be a potential clinical predictor of improved survival."

Hypothyroidism (mean serum TSH 52.03 mIU/L) was detected at a mean age of 4.6 months (range 3-6) in 3 infants with infantile hepatic hemangiomas, treated with thyroxine (mean dose 12 µg/kg/day). All received treatment with propranolol (1-3 mg/kg/day) from the mean age of 4 months. Hormonal treatment was stopped at a mean age of 20 months (range 12-30). Hypothyroidism reoccurred in a patient concurrently with the increase of liver lesions, requiring liver transplantation (LT) at age 39 months.Literature review retrieved 42 studies (48 patients): HH (n = 43) were isolated in 24 infants and associated with cutaneous hemangiomas in 19. Hemangiomas were only cutaneous in 5.In the first 43 patients, hypothyroidism was detected at a mean age of 1 month; 21 of 43 patients were prescribed propranolol alone (n = 8) or associated with other medicaments (n = 13); 2 of 43 patients underwent LT. Hormonal treatment consisted of T4 in 35 of 43 patients and T3 in 10.CH associated with only cutaneous and extrahepatic visceral hemangiomas (n = 5), detected at a mean age of 7 months (TSH mean levels at diagnosis of 150.3 mIU/L). Three of 5 patients received treatment with propranolol ± other medicaments. All 5 patients were treated with T4.
Periodical thyroid function assessment is necessary in patients with hepatic hemangiomas, particularly when lesions' size and number increase rapidly."

Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) is a biochemical condition with high prevalence in HD patients. The present multicentric study aimed to assess the relationship between UP and SCH in HD patients.
The present cross-sectional study included 328 HD patients. All patients were submitted to careful history through clinical examination and standard laboratory assessment. Pruritis was evaluated using the pruritis visual analog scale (VAS). Patients were diagnosed with SCH if they had TSH levels above the upper limit of the normal reference range in association with normal free thyroxine (FT4) levels.
Among the studied patients, there were 196 patients (59.8 %) with UP. Comparison between patients with UP and patients without revealed that patients in the former group had significantly longer HD duration (median (IQR): 47.5 (27.0-72.5) versus 36.0 (23.0-50.5) months, p0.001) and lower Kt/v (median (IQR): 1.4 (1.09-1.7) versus 1.54 (1.12-1.91), p=0.009). Moreover, they had significantly higher ferritin (median (IQR): 653.0 (526.0-800.0) versus 628.0 (470.8-716.0) ng/mL), hsCRP (median (IQR): 12.0 (8.0-14.0) versus 8.0 (6.0-9.0) mg/dL,p0.001) and TSH levels (median (IQR): 4.34 (1.98-5.2) versus 3.34 (1.9-4.85) µIU/ml) with a significantly higher frequency of SCH (45.9 % versus 28.8 %, p=0.002).

67-year-old woman's clinical findings, laboratory results, fundus fluorescein angiography, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) are given. Over a two-year period, the patient was monitored.
A 67-year-old woman presented to the outpatient clinic with vitreous and dense subretinal hemorrhages in her right eye. RAM rupture was discovered along the suprotemporal retinal arteriole. A diagnosis of systemic arterial hypertension was made. Two months later, the vitreous hemorrhage spontaneously resolved and the patient's vision improved. After nine months of initial presentation, the patient developed another RAM. Meanwhile the patient developed ichthyosis caused by hypothyroidism. Because fundus fluorescein angiography revealed that the first RAM was still active, an intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF was administered six months afterwards. More proximal RAM with macular edema developed after another six months necessitating laser photocoagulation. However macular edema didn't resolve and a second injection of intravitreal anti-VEGF was given.
Patients with RAMs, particularly if multiple or recurring, should be thoroughly investigated and assessed, particularly for secondary causes of hypertension. OCT and OCTA are useful tools for RAM confirmation and follow-up. It is important to look into how RAM behavior interacts with coexisting macular edema, and other variables affecting hemodynamic status."

The purpose of this study was to functionally characterize p.Cys1281Tyr variant in the TG gene in order to increase our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms associated with CH. In order to find evidence that support the hypothesis that the p.Cys1281Tyr variant would affect the TG folding were performed amino acid prediction, 3D modeling and transient expression analysis in HEK293T cells. 18 of the 21″in silico"" algorithms predict a deleterious effect of the p.Cys1281Tyr variant. The full-length 3D model p.Cys1281Tyr TG showed disulfide bond cleavage between the cysteines at positions 1249 and 1281 and rearrangement of the TG structure, while transient expression analysis indicated that p.Cys1281Tyr causes retention of the protein inside the cell. Consequently, these results show that this pathogenic variant makes it impossible for TG to fulfill its function in the biosynthesis process of thyroid hormones, causing CH. In conclusion, our results confirm the pathophysiological importance of misfolding of TG as a consequence of p.Cys1281Tyr variant located in the hinge module/flap region of TG."

The incidence of SCH is estimated at 4.4-8.5% of the general population and occurs more frequently in women. Given that it falls below the diagnostic threshold, SCH is monitored rather than treated. Its management is a common topic of debate as SCH frequently progresses into overt hypothyroidism and is linked to long-term hyperlipidemia, endothelial dysfunction, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease. Premature hormone administration and lifestyle interventions have been explored as treatment options to mitigate the symptoms of SCH. Our review compares both modalities' efficacy and potential for standardized clinical practice. A trial of levothyroxine demonstrated significant results in specific SCH demographics, such as patients who are pregnant or trying to conceive, those with goiter, those with thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody status, those with steadily increasing TSH, children, and adolescents. All other SCH patients presenting with chronic symptoms may also be reasonably considered for a three- to six-month trial of treatment. Lifestyle modifications through improved sleep hygiene, a diet within the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for iodine and selenium, increased exercise, and smoking cessation also proved efficacious. Our findings indicate that a synergistic approach to treatment is most favorable. Lifestyle modifications neither show adverse effects nor contraindications and can be safely recommended alone or alongside levothyroxine for the treatment of SCH."

Recent studies have shown that dietary habits, oxidative stress, and inflammation may play roles in thyroid hypofunction. Thus, the present article aimed to determine the relationship between major dietary patterns and oxidative stress and inflammation in primary hypothyroid patients and healthy people in Iranian adults.
This matched case-control study was conducted on 200 participants (100 cases and 100 controls). The presence of primary hypothyroidism was determined by endocrinologists based on American Thyroid Association (ATA) criteria. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated 168-item, semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The principal component analysis (PCA) method was used to derive major dietary patterns. Statistical analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis, and the findings were reported using odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs.
We identified 2 major dietary patterns (i.e., healthy and Western dietary patterns). After adjusting for confounding variables, participants in the highest tertile of the healthy eating pattern had lower odds of primary hypothyroidism. Also, there was a significant relationship between total antioxidant capacity (TAC) levels and thyroid hypofunction; however, no significant correlation was seen between the Western dietary pattern and malondialdehyde (MDA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) with hypothyroidism.
There were statistically direct associations between healthy dietary patterns (loaded with vegetables, nuts and seeds, fruits, dried fruits, olives, garlic, black pepper, starchy vegetables, low-fat dairy, and legumes) and increased TAC levels with a decreased risk of thyroid hypofunction. However, Western dietary patterns and MDA and CRP levels did not associate with an underactive thyroid."

We conducted a population-based study of infants born in Canada, 2004-2020. We used ""winter"" months (i.e., September through June) and northern areas of residence as indicators of less sunlight/less active lifestyle, while ""summer"" (i.e., July and August) and southern areas were considered as reference. Rate of gastroschisis for infants conceived in winter (3.4 per 10,000) was higher than for infants conceived in summer (2.2 per 10,000; p < 0.001). Exposure to winter, and northern area, hypothyroidism, substance or tobacco uses and depressive disorder were initially identified as risk factors for gastroschisis. There was a significant interaction between women < 24 years of age and 2-month conception intervals (rate ratio (RR): 1.42 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-1.70). The association of maternal depression (mean ratio 2.19, 95% CI 0.87-3.50, p = 0.001) with infant gastroschisis was mediated by hypothyroidism (mean ratio 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07, p < 0.001), whereas substance use, hypothyroidism, tobacco smoking and gestational diabetes showed 5.5-, 3.1-, 2.7-, and 1.2-fold associations, respectively, with maternal depression. In contrast to the summer conception interval of low gastroschisis risk, an elevated risk of gastroschisis spans the other ten months in association with higher levels of stress adaptation, thermoregulation and metabolism, reproduction, and growth effector hormones. Our findings suggest that periconception depression with mediation by hypothyroidism, may play a causal role in offspring gastroschisis."

The study was a retrospective analysis of the birth status, physical growth, and neuromotor development of patients aged 0 to 5 years, who were diagnosed with subclinical hypothyroidism during newborn screening (NBS) in Zhongshan between 2016 and 2019. Based on preliminary results, we compared 3 groups: with thyroid-stimulating factor (TSH) value of 5-10 mIU/L (442 cases), TSH value of 10-20 mIU/L (208 cases), and TSH above 20 mIU/L (77 cases). Patients with TSH value above 5 mIU/L were called back for repeat testing and were divided into 4 groups as follows: mild subclinical hypothyroidism group 1 with a TSH value of 5-10 mIU/L in both initial screening and repeat testing; mild subclinical hypothyroidism group 2 with TSH value above 10 mIU/L in initial screening; and TSH value of 5-10 mIU/L in repeat testing; the severe subclinical hypothyroidism group with TSH value of 10-20 mIU/L in both the initial screening and repeat testing and the congenital hypothyroidism group.
There were no significant differences in the maternal age, type of delivery, gender, length, and weight at birth between the preliminary groups; however, the gestational age at birth was significantly different (F = 5.268, p = 0.005). The z-score for length at birth was lower in the congenital hypothyroidism group compared to the other 3 groups but showed no difference at 6 months of age. The z-score for length in mild subclinical hypothyroidism group 2 was lower compared to the other 3 groups but showed no difference at 2-5 years of age. At 2 years of age there was no significant difference in the developmental quotient (DQ) of the Gesell Developmental Scale between the groups.
The gestational age at birth affected the neonatal TSH level. Intrauterine growth in infants with congenital hypothyroidism was retarded compared to that of infants with subclinical hypothyroidism. Neonates with a TSH value of 10-20 mIU/L in the initial screening and a TSH value of 5-10 mIU/L in the repeat testing showed developmental delay at 18 months but caught up at age 2 years. There was no difference in neuromotor development between the groups. Levothyroxine in patients with mild subclinical hypothyroidism is not required, but we recommend that the growth and development of such infants and young children continues to be monitored."

Data on hypothyroidism among adult females are essential to understand the underactive status of the thyroid gland among the female population and its correlated effects on a deficiency of vitamin D and iron, as effective prevention of osteoporotic changes and iron deficiency anemia is possible. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate the probability of concurrent iron and vitamin D deficiency among the adult hypothyroid female population of Abu Dhabi, UAE.
This cross-sectional study was carried out from September 2019 to July 2021 among 500 adult females aged 18 to 45 years old in Sheikh Shakhbout Medical City (SSMC) and Sheikh Khalifa Medical City (SKMC), Abu Dhabi, UAE. After obtaining written informed consent, subjects' demographic characteristics (sun exposure, dressing code, food consumption), anthropometry (height, weight, BMI), and biochemical parameters (thyroid profile, vitamin D profile, iron profile, and blood indices) were measured.
In this study, serum vitamin D and iron levels were significantly (p<0.01) decreased in the hypothyroid female group (study group). The serum vitamin D and iron levels showed a significant negative (p<0.01) correlation with thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Out of 250 study group participants, 61 had a concurrent deficiency of serum vitamin D and iron, yielding a probability (P of low vitamin D and iron and hypothyroidism) of 0.244, which indicates that if 1000 hypothyroid patients are tested for serum vitamin D and iron levels, 24 patients are probable to have low vitamin D and iron.
The study concluded that vitamin D and iron bi-deficiency were observed in adult hypothyroid females in Abu Dhabi, UAE. So, the routine check-up of thyroid function and vitamin D and iron profiles should be done early. Therefore, early vitamin D and iron deficiencies can be detected, and supplements can be given to prevent further health complications like osteoporosis and iron deficiency anemia."

We compared women with a concomitant diagnosis of hypothyroidism to those without. Women with hyperthyroidism were excluded. Pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal outcomes were compared between the two groups.
Overall, 14,882 women met inclusion criteria. Among them, 1882 (12.65%) had a concomitant diagnosis of hypothyroidism, and 13,000 (87.35%) did not. Women with concomitant hypothyroidism, compared to those without, were characterized by increased maternal age (25.5% ≥ 35 years vs. 18%, p < 0.001, respectively), and had a higher rate of multiple gestations (7.1% vs. 5.7%, p = 0.023). Interestingly, pregnancy, delivery and neonatal outcomes were comparable between the groups, except for a higher rate of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonates in the group with hypothyroidism (4.1% vs. 3.2%, p = 0.033) (Tables 2 and 3).

Patients with a detailed thyroid hormone profile at ALL diagnosis were enrolled. Hypothyroidism was defined as low serum levels of free tetraiodothyronine (FT4) and/or free triiodothyronine (FT3). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to create survival curves, and multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to screen prognostic factors associated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). There were 276 children eligible for the study, and 184 patients (66.67%) were diagnosed with hypothyroidism, including 90 cases (48.91%) with functional central hypothyroidism and 82 cases (44.57%) with low T3 syndrome. Hypothyroidism was correlated with the dosages of L-Asparaginase (L-Asp) (P = .004) and glucocorticoids (P = .010), central nervous system (CNS) status (P = .012), number of severe infections (grade 3, 4 or 5) (P = .026) and serum albumin level (P = .032). Hypothyroidism was an independent prognostic factor for PFS in ALL children (P = .024, 95% CI: 1.1-4.1).

Metabolic syndrome is one of the central mechanism in the development of NAFLD. Hypothyroidism is one of the conditions associated with metabolic syndrome. In this study we assess the NAFLD induced by hypothyroidism.
This study was conducted in tertiary care hospitals attached to BMCRI. 44 patients including both clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism, who were non-diabetic and had no significant alcohol intake, were included in the study. The level of NAFLD was assessed by ultrasound and fibroscan and the same was compared between clinical and subclinical hypothyroid patients.
On comparing the Ultrasonography grading of hepatic steatosis between the clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism group it was found that a significantly higher grade (p &lt; 0.05) of hepatic steatosis was seen in the clinical hypothyroidism group i.e 11 out of 29 subjects had grade III hepatic steatosis (37.9%), Out of the 29 subjects in the clinical hypothyroidism group, F2 F3 and F4 fibrosis grade was seen in 5,5 and 6 individuals respectively. While in the subclinical group 14 out of the 15 individuals had F0 to F1 grade of fibrosis. There was a significantly higher (p &lt; 0.0.5) fibrosis score in Clinical hypothyroidism group when compared to subclinical group.
In our study we observed that Clinical and Subclinical Hypothyroidism are independent risk factors for the development of NAFLD. There was significantly higher level of NAFLD in Clinical Hypothyroidism patients when compared with Subclinical Hypothyroidism subjects. References Younossi Z, Anstee QM, Marietti M, et al.

In the present study, we analyze the data of the national newborn thyroid screening program in North Macedonia collected over twenty years, including the CH prevalence as well as its geographical and ethnic variations.
The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was measured on a filter paper blood spot sample using the DELFIA fluoroimmunometric assay. A TSH value of 15 mIU/L whole blood was used as the cutoff point until 2010 and 10 mIU/L thereafter.
Out of 377,508 screened live births, a total of 226 newborns with primary CH were detected, providing an overall prevalence of 6.0 per 10,000. Lowering the TSH cutoff led to an apparently increased prevalence of the transient CH, from 0.2 to 2.4 per 10,000 live births (p < 0.0001) with an impact on the overall prevalence of primary CH (from 4.0 to 7.1 per 10,000, p=0.0001). Taking ethnicity into account, the significantly highest primary CH prevalence of 11.3 per 10,000 live births was observed among the Roma neonates, with a predominance of permanent CH (75.5%). There were also regional differences in the prevalence of primary CH. The highest primary CH prevalence of 11.7 per 10,000 live births was observed in the Vardar region, together with the highest regional prevalence of the transient CH (3.2 per 10,000). The highest prevalence of permanent CH was observed in the Pelagonia region (6.6 per 10,000) where the largest percentage of the Roma population lives.
The overall CH prevalence is high in North Macedonia, with substantial ethnic and geographical variations. Further analysis to elucidate the causes for the significant variations in the CH prevalence including environmental factors is warranted."

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of thyroid disorders in a group of apparently healthy Syrians and investigate the relationship between subclinical hypothyroidism and metabolic syndrome (MetS).
A retrospective, cross-sectional study was performed at Al-Assad University Hospital. Participants were healthy individuals aged 18 years and older. Data about their biochemical tests, weight, height, BMI, and blood pressure were collected and analyzed. Participants were categorized according to their thyroid tests into euthyroid, subclinical hypothyroid, subclinical hyperthyroid, and according to their BMI into normal, overweight, and obese, and according to the International Diabetes Foundation into normal and having MetS.
A total of 1111 participants were involved in this study. Subclinical hypothyroidism and subclinical hyperthyroidism were found in 4.4 and 1.2% of participants, respectively. The incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism was significantly increased in females and in the presence of positive antithyroid peroxidase. Subclinical hypothyroidism was significantly associated with MetS, a higher waist circumference, central obesity, and triglycerides; however, there was no correlation with high-density lipoprotein.
The prevalence of thyroid disorders among Syrians was consistent with the results of other studies. These disorders were significantly more common in females compared to males. Add to that, subclinical hypothyroidism was significantly associated with MetS. Since MetS is a known factor for morbidity and mortality, this may raise the attention needed to perform future prospective trials to evaluate the possible benefits of subclinical hypothyroidism treatment with a low dose of thyroxin."

However, since the discrepancy between these study results may reside in the great heterogeneity of the populations studied, this relationship is controversial. This study aimed to explore the changes in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) between subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) and well-matched euthyroid (EU) groups. Multiple databases were searched for publications before December 1, 2021, including cross-sectional studies on the association between SCH and lipid profile matched by age, gender, and BMI. Twenty-five articles with 3347 participants were included for meta-analysis. The results showed that the TC, TG, and LDL-c levels of the SCH groups were higher than the EU groups (TC, SMD=0.49, 95% CI 0.27, 0.71, p<0.001) (TG, SMD=0.43, 95% CI 0.21, 0.64, p<0.05 ) (LDL-c, SMD=0.75, 95% CI 0.46, 1.03, p<0.001 ). The HDL-c levels of the SCH group were lower than the control group (SMD=-0.53, 95% CI -0.81, -0.25, p<0.05). SCH has a larger impact on LDL-c than the other three indicators. After subgroup analyses, there was a larger impact on lipid alteration in the subgroup of TSH>10 μIU/ml, especially on LDL-c. This study found that SCH was associated with altered lipid profiles. Appropriate clinical treatment may be needed to prevent dyslipidemia and related diseases."

Hypothyroidism secondary to an autoimmune thyroiditis associated with trastuzumab was diagnosed, the first case described in Portugal and the fourth case described worldwide. Our intention regarding the publication of this case report is to alert the clinicians treating people with trastuzumab that they should ask the patients about symptoms of hypothyroidism and should screen the thyroid function of the patients before, during, and after the initiation of trastuzumab.
Trastuzumab is a humanized MAB used in HER2-positive breast and gastric cancer. Trastuzumab-associated autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) is rare (incidence rate in an RCT of 0.3%). Manifestations of autoimmune thyroiditis associated with trastuzumab resemble those of hypothyroidism in other clinical contexts, but the presence of goiter is highlighted as a reason for medical evaluation. Biochemically, it is characterized by an increased thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) with or without a low FT4/FT3, and sonographically with a pattern of thyroiditis. The treatment consists of levothyroxine, in a dose of 1.6-1.8 µg/kg/day, with re-evaluation of the thyroid function in 4-6 weeks. We report the first case of autoimmune thyroiditis secondary to trastuzumab in Portugal.

Pooled prevalence was calculated using a generalized linear mixed model, and expressed as a rate per 10,000 neonates. The meta-analysis involved 116 studies, which analyzed 330,210,785 neonates, among whom 174,543 were diagnosed with CH. The pooled global prevalence of CH from 1969 to 2020 was 4.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 3.96-4.57). The geographic region with highest prevalence was the Eastern Mediterranean (7.91, 95% CI 6.09-10.26), where the prevalence was 2.48-fold (95% CI 2.04-3.01) that in Europe. The national income level with the highest prevalence was upper-middle (6.76, 95% CI 5.66-8.06), which was 1.91-fold (95% CI 1.65-2.22) that in high-income countries. Global prevalence of CH was 52% (95% CI 4-122%) higher in 2011-2020 than in 1969-1980, after adjusting for geographic region, national income level, and screening strategy.  Conclusion: The global prevalence of CH increased from 1969 to 2020, which may reflect the implementation of national neonatal screening, neonatal testing for thyroid-stimulating hormone, and a lowering of the diagnostic level of this hormone. Additional factors are likely to be driving the increase, which should be identified in future research. What is Known: • Cumulated evidence had suggested that the occurrences of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) among newborns were varied in different countries.. • Up-trends of the birth prevalence of CH were observed in many European and American countries. What is New: • This is the first meta-analysis to estimate global and regional prevalence of CH among newborns. • The global prevalence of CH has increased by 127% since 1969.

The assessment of serum TSH levels is also deemed to be the most robust and accurate biomarker during the management of replacement therapy in patients with a previous diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism. In line with a reflex TSH laboratory strategy, free thyroxine is measured only if the TSH falls outside specific cutoffs, in order to streamline investigations and save unjustified costs. This serum TSH-based approach to both diagnosis and monitoring has been widely accepted by several national and local health services; nevertheless, false-negative or -positive testing may occur, leading to inappropriate management or treatment.

The purpose of this systematic review is the evaluation of the effect of herbal medicine on the signs and symptoms of primary hypothyroidism.
PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched until 4 May, 2021. We selected randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that have assessed the effect of herbal medicine on hypothyroidism.
Out of 771 articles, 4 trials with 186 participants were included. In one study, Nigella sativa L. caused a significant decrease in weight (P=0.004) and body mass index (BMI) (P=0.002). TSH levels were reported to be decreased and T3 increased in the treatment group (P =0.03) (P=0.008), respectively. In another study on Nigella sativa L., results did not show a significant difference between the two groups (p=0.02). A significant decrease in total cholesterol (CHL) and fasting blood sugar (FBS) was reported in participants with negative anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies. In patients with positive anti-TPO antibodies, a significant increase in total cholesterol and FBS was observed in the intervention group (p=0.02). In the third RCT, T3 in the ashwagandha group at 4 and 8 weeks significantly increased by 18.6% (p=0.012) and 41.5% (p < 0.001), respectively. A noticeable increase was found in the T4 level from baseline by 9.3% (p= 0.002) and 19.6% (p < 0.001) at 4 and 8 weeks, respectively. TSH levels fell remarkably in the intervention group compared to placebo at 4 weeks (p <0.001) and 8 weeks (p <0.001), respectively.

We sought to comprehend the rate and associated risk factors for developing hypothyroidism following hemithyroidectomy at King Abdulaziz University Hospital (KAUH). Methods In this retrospective study, we reviewed the medical records of all patients who had hemithyroidectomies for benign and malignant conditions between January 2008 and August 2022. Patients were analyzed for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), comorbidities, family history of thyroid disease, thyroid antibodies, and pre- and postoperative thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). Pre- and postoperative TSH levels were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results From 153 cases, 39 patients met the inclusion criteria; 31 (79.5%) were females. Seventeen (43.59%) patients developed biochemical hypothyroidism within two years following hemithyroidectomy; the majority (64.71%) of those with hypothyroidism developed it within the first six months. There was a significant increase in TSH levels following surgery (p < 0.001). Conclusion The overall incidence of hypothyroidism within two years of hemithyroidectomy is 43.59%; among those who developed hypothyroidism, the majority (64.71%) did so within the first six months. Thus, we strongly recommend continuous monitoring of TSH levels in the first six months, as it may aid in the decision to begin treatment before symptoms develop."

The Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD) was used to identify patients who underwent surgery for mucosal head and neck cancer (oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx) between 2010 and 2017. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were performed to determine patient, tumor, and hospital related risk factors for 30-day readmission. Readmitted patients were stratified by preoperative diagnosis of hypothyroidism to compare readmission characteristics.
For the 131,013 patients who met inclusion criteria, the readmission rate was 15.9%. Overall, 11.91% of patients had a preoperative diagnosis of hypothyroidism. After controlling for other variables, patients with a preoperative diagnosis of hypothyroidism had 12.2% higher odds of readmission compared to those without hypothyroidism (OR: 1.12, 1.03-1.22, p = 0.008). Patients with hypothyroidism had different reasons for readmission, including higher rates of wound dehiscence, fistula, infection, and electrolyte imbalance. Among readmitted patients, the length of stay for index admission (mean 10.5 days vs. 9.2 days, p < 0.001), readmission (mean 7.0 vs. 6.6 days, p = 0.05), and total hospital charge were higher for hypothyroid patients ($137,742 vs. $119,831, p < 0.001).
Hypothyroidism is an independent risk factor for 30-day readmission following head and neck cancer resection. Furthermore, hypothyroid patients are more likely to be readmitted for wound complications, infection, and electrolyte imbalance. Targeted interventions should be considered for hypothyroid patients to decrease readmission rates and associated patient morbidity, potentially leading to earlier initiation of adjuvant treatment.

Thyroid hormones regulate bone metabolism, and the role of subclinical hypothyroidism on bone mineral density (BMD) is still controversial. Hence, this study aims to assess the association of subclinical hypothyroidism with femoral osteopenia and osteoporosis in individuals aged 50 years or older.
This retrospective cohort study was carried out with 864 outpatients having at least one result for TSH levels before the first record of dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). The primary endpoints were osteopenia (-2.5 standard deviation (SD) <T-score <-1.0SD) and osteoporosis (T-score ≤-2.5SD). Cox proportional hazards regression assessed the association of subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH ≥4.5 mIU/L) with osteopenia and osteoporosis in unadjusted and covariate-adjusted models. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were calculated, and p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
There was no significant association between subclinical hypothyroidism and femoral osteopenia in either unadjusted [HR: 1.149 (0.835-1.580); p=0.394] or fully covariate-adjusted models [HR: 1.069 (0.774-1.477); p=0.687]. Subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with femoral osteoporosis in the unadjusted analysis [HR: 1.981 (1.044-3.757); p= 0.036], but a lack of association occurred and remained after successive covariate-adjustments analyses [HR: 1.392 (0.615-3.152); p=0.428].
Subclinical hypothyroidism is not independently associated with either femoral osteopenia or osteoporosis in individuals aged 50 years or older over a four-year follow-up time."

The aim of this study was to assess the association of SCH and cardiovascular outcomes in patients undergoing PCI. We searched PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and CENTRAL databases from its inception until April 1, 2022 for studies comparing the outcomes between SCH and euthyroid patients undergoing PCI. Outcomes of interest include cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), repeat revascularization and heart failure. Outcomes were pooled using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model and reported as risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 7 studies involving 1132 patients with SCH and 11,753 euthyroid patients were included in the analysis. Compared with euthyroid patients, patients with SCH had significantly higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (RR 2.16, 95% CI: 1.38-3.38, P < 0.001), all-cause mortality (RR 1.68, 95% CI: 1.23-2.29, P = 0.001) and repeat revascularization (RR 1.96, 95% CI: 1.08-3.58, P = 0.03).

However, their relationship in this population remains unknown. The study assessed the association between SCH and MetS in 1706 first-episode drug-naïve (FEDN) MDD patients. We also compared the relationship between MetS and clinical symptoms in patients with and without comorbid SCH. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive subscale, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were used to detect clinical symptoms. Serum levels of free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), anti-thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidases antibody, cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and fasting glucose were measured. The Area Under the Curve (AUC) was used to test the performance of serum TSH in identifying MetS patients. The prevalence of MetS and SCH was 34.5% (n = 585) and 61% (n = 1034), respectively. The presence of SCH increased the risk of MetS, hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, and low HDL-C by 4.91, 3.51, 3.54, 2.02, and 2.34 times, respectively. Serum TSH had a nice ability to distinguish MetS patients from non-MetS patients (AUC value = 0.77). MetS and its components exhibited a positive association with clinical profiles only in SCH patients, but not in non-SCH patients. Taken together, our study suggested SCH was closely related to MetS and might play a vital role in the relationship between MetS and clinical symptoms. Regular thyroid function checks might help early detect MetS."

318,36942807,2023-03-22,Effect of obesity and hypothyroidism on hepcidin concentration in pregnancy - a pilot study using maternal and umbilical cord blood at delivery day.,N/A,"Hepcidin is a primary regulator of iron metabolism in the human body. By promoting ferroportin degradation, hepcidin reduces intestinal iron absorption and its release from intracellular stores. In the course of pregnancy, gradually declining hepcidin concentrations encourage placental iron transfer, thereby providing the appropriate amount of iron for fetal development. Hence, we aimed to investigate changes in maternal and cord blood hepcidin and iron metabolism parameters in normal-weight (n=17) and obese (n=17) gestating women, as well as gravid women with a history of hypothyroidism following the restoration of euthyroidism (n=17). All blood samples were taken on the day of delivery, and ELISA kits were used for measurements. A significant increase in maternal hepcidin concentration was observed in obese pregnant women, compared to normal-weight controls (29.53±4.20 ng/mL vs. 25.69±5.70 ng/mL; P<0.05). However, only a slight, insignificant tendency for lower hepcidin was noted in the hypothyroid group, compared to the healthy controls (23.10±6.00 ng/mL vs. 25.69±5.70 ng/mL; P=NS). Moreover, decreased maternal free triiodothyronine, triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, and ferritin levels were revealed in the hypothyroid group, compared to the normal-weight individuals (P<0.05). Furthermore, positive correlations between maternal hepcidin and the majority of maternal thyroid hormones were found, with a most potent relation to FT3 (r=0.40; P<0.01). Interestingly, no alterations of thyroid hormones and iron metabolism parameters were noticed in cord blood in any of the subgroups. In summary, pre-pregnancy obesity is associated with elevated maternal hepcidin, albeit no signs of lowered cord blood iron status were shown. Medical history of hypothyroidism following the restoration of euthyroidism does not substantially influence maternal nor cord blood hepcidin concentration, as well as fetal iron homeostasis, even though free thyroid hormone levels correlate with maternal hepcidin."

This study examined the effect of hypothyroidism on the structural development of the gastrointestinal tract and the activity of brush-border digestive enzymes in the ovine fetus near term. In intact fetuses studied between 100 and 144 days of gestation (dGA; term ∼145 days), plasma concentrations of T3, cortisol and gastrin; the mucosal thickness in the abomasum, duodenum, jejunum and ileum; and intestinal villus height and crypt depth increased with gestational age. Removal of the fetal thyroid gland at 105-110 dGA suppressed plasma thyroxine (T4) and T3 concentrations to the limit of assay detection in fetuses studied at 130 and 144 dGA, and decreased plasma cortisol and gastrin near term, compared to age-matched intact fetuses. Hypothyroidism was associated with reductions in the relative weights of the stomach compartments and small intestines, the outer perimeter of the intestines, the thickness of the gastric and intestinal mucosa, villus height and width, and crypt depth. The thickness of the mucosal epithelial cell layer and muscularis propria in the small intestines were not affected by gestational age or treatment. Activities of the brush border enzymes varied with gestational age in a manner that depended on the enzyme and region of the small intestines studied. In the ileum, maltase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) activities were lower, and aminopeptidase N (ApN) were higher, in the hypothyroid compared to intact fetuses near term.

T cells from Tg-Trh showed increased proliferation than wild-type (WT) euthyroid mice in response to polyclonal activation. The release of Th1 pro-inflammatory cytokines was also increased in Tg-Trh and TSH levels correlated with T-cell proliferation. To gain further mechanistic insights into hypothyroidism-related immunosuppression, we evaluated T-cell subpopulations in lymphoid tissues of hypothyroid and control mice. No differences were observed in CD3/CD19 or CD4/CD8 ratios between these strains. However, the frequency of regulatory T cells (Tregs) was significantly increased in hypothyroid mice, and not in Tg-Trh mice.

Abnormal morphological development could partly explain impaired adult auditory function. However, whether the development of inner hair cell ribbon synapses is influenced by hypothyroidism remains unclear. In the present study, we characterize the normal degeneration pattern of Kölliker's organ along the basal-to-apical axis. Then, we verified the retardation of morphological development in congenital hypothyroid mice. Using this model, we found that twisted collagen is present in the major tectorial membrane and delayed separation from supporting cells affects the minor tectorial membrane. Finally, we found that the number of synaptic ribbons was not significantly altered but the ribbon synapse maturation process was significantly impaired in congenital hypothyroid mice. We conclude that thyroid hormone is involved in structural development of the tectorial membrane and the ribbon synapse maturation process."

The thyroid produces three hormones that are essential for regulating body temperature, energy production, weight, hair and nail growth, and menstrual cycle maintenance. The production of these hormones is controlled by a feedback mechanism. Various factors cause changes in the stimulation and inhibition of these hormones, which ultimately causes either excessive release or a decrease in the levels of thyroid hormones. These causes can be physiological or pathological. One of the physiological causes is pregnancy. Pregnancy is a very complex process in which many changes occur in the body and its functioning. One of which is changes in the maternal thyroid gland. The inability to adequately adapt to the changes leads to the abnormal functioning of the thyroid gland. During pregnancy, there is a variation in the concentration of thyroid hormones which may cause a decrease in levels or inhibition in the production of thyroid hormones. This condition is called hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism in pregnant mothers can either be gestational or may be a condition that is present way before her pregnancy. Often, gestational hypothyroidism reverts after delivery during the postpartum period but can also be present as subclinical hypothyroidism. In such cases, they pose a significant threat to development, cause growth hindrance to the infant in the womb, and cause abnormalities in the offspring in the future. Some of the changes occur in the gland because of enhancement in levels of thyroid binding globulin, increased clearance rate of iodine from the body in kidneys, altered effects in human chorionic gonadotropin hormone, and decreased consumption of iodine in meals. Iodine disbalance in maternal hypothyroidism is associated with severe health issues like cretinism and mental retardation. Thyroid hormones are crucial for the infant's neural, cognitive, and intelligence quotient development in the womb. Thus, the disturbances in the maternal hormone levels disturb typical early developmental characteristics. In the world of rapidly advancing scientific research, there are many ways in which this condition can be detected early, diagnosed correctly, and given apt and required attention and treatment for causing the least harm to the fetus and the mother."

A total of 48 CH patients with normal, goitrous (n 5) or hypoplastic thyroid (n 5) were studied by high-throughput sequencing using a custom-designed 23-gene panel. Patients initially categorized as TCH (n 15), PCH (n 26) and persistent hyperthyrotropinemia (PHT, n 7) were re-evaluated after genetic testing.
Re-evaluation based on genetic testing changed the initial diagnoses from PCH to PHT (n 2) or TCH (n 3) and from PHT to TCH (n 5), which resulted in a final distribution of TCH (n 23), PCH (n 21) and PHT (n 4). Genetic analysis also allowed us to discontinue treatment in five patients with monoallelic TSHR or DUOX2, or no pathogenic variants. The main reasons for changes in diagnosis and treatment were the detection of monoallelic TSHR variants and the misdiagnosis of thyroid hypoplasia on neonatal ultrasound in low birthweight infants. A total of 41 (35 different, 15 novel) variants were detected in 65% (n 31) of the cohort.

Targeted NGS was performed in 103 CH-GIS patients from the French national screening program referred to the Reference Center for Rare Thyroid Diseases of Angers University Hospital. The custom targeted NGS panel contained 48 genes. Cases were classified as solved or probably solved depending on the known inheritance of the gene, the classification of the variants according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, the familial segregation, and published functional studies. Thyroid-stimulating hormone at CH screening and at diagnosis (TSHsc and TSHdg) and free T4 at diagnosis (FT4dg) were recorded.
NGS identified 95 variants in 10 genes in 73 of the 103 patients, resulting in 25 solved cases and 18 probably solved cases. They were mainly due to mutations in the TG (n = 20) and TPO (n = 15) genes.

The behavior and cognition were assessed using the open field test, T-maze, and novel object recognition test. We found significant differences in the behavioral patterns of the hypothyroid animals showing a reduction in locomotor activity, frequency of rearing, and impaired memory function compared to the euthyroid controls. As serotonin is an essential biomarker regulating cognition and mood, we tried to modulate the serotonin mediation in hypothyroid animals through tryptophan administration. Treatment with 5-hydroxy-tryptophan (5-OH-TRP) intraperitoneally for 10 days or directly into the hippocampus as a single injection led to attenuation of the hypothyroidism-induced cognitive and memory decline. A staggering amount of research is suggesting that the common denominators in the pathophysiology of depression and the behavior changes in hypothyroidism are the hippocampal complex and the distorted serotonin metabolism. In our study, it was observed a significant alleviation of cognitive impairment and an improvement of memory performance in hypothyroid rats after 5-OH-TRP administration.

Consistent with high production rate of T4S and rT3S, there are high serum sulfated iodothyronine analogs, including T4S, T3S, rT3S, and 3,3'-T2S (T2S), in ovine and human fetal and preterm infants. Fetal TH metabolic pathways predict T2S as the major TH metabolite in the fetus. Since maternal T2S appears to be quantitatively derived from fetal T3 (the active TH), the amount of T2S in the maternal compartment correlates with fetal thyroid function in sheep. In humans, maternal serum contains high levels of radioimmunoassayable T2S; however, it displays as a peak adjacent to but unidentical to synthetic T2S on HLPC and we named it the W-Compound. Levels of W-Compound increase during pregnancy and peak as high as 20-fold to that of nonpregnant women. Maternal serum levels of W-Compound significantly correlate with fetal T4 and W-compound concentrations but not maternal serum T4 in euthyroid or hyperthyroid women, showing a distinct difference between fetal and maternal in TH metabolism. Fetal T2S is actively transferred to the mother via placenta and the quantity of T2S or its metabolite (W-Compound) in maternal compartment reflects fetal thyroid function. Thus, maternal serum W-Compound may be a biomarker for monitoring fetal thyroid function "

A total of 553 patients with chronic kidney disease were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore the association between hypothyroidism and urinary CER. The mean urinary CER was 1.01 ± 0.38 g/day and 121 patients (22%) had hypothyroidism. The multiple linear regression analysis revealed explanatory variables with urinary CER, including age, sex, body mass index, 24 h Cr clearance (24hrCcr), and albumin while hypothyroidism was not considered an independent explanatory variable. In addition, scatter plot analysis with regression fit line representing the association between estimated GFR calculated using s-Cr (eGFRcre) and 24hrCcr revealed that eGFRcre and 24hrCcr had strong correlations with each other in hypothyroid patients as well as euthyroid patients.

A large population-based study on the spectrum of symptoms in subclinical hypothyroidism showed similar rates of thyroid disease-related symptoms compared with euthyroid subjects, while the TSH concentration had no impact on symptom score. Together, these findings make it challenging to attribute symptoms to their underlying cause. This is also true in the case of unexplained persistent symptoms in levothyroxine-treated patients. Although generally considered a life-long replacement therapy, successful thyroid hormone discontinuation resulting in euthyroidism has been reported in approximately one third of patients. Thus, we overtreat patients with (subclinical) hypothyroidism, highlighting the importance of reliable diagnostic criteria. The diagnostic process, including the implementation of robust TSH and FT4 reference intervals, is especially challenging in specific situations including aging, pregnancy, non-thyroidal illness, and central hypothyroidism.

Samples of liver (LVR), kidney (KID), fetal placenta (PLC), and the corresponding maternal endometrium (END) were collected from a subset of fetuses (n = 32). Fetuses exposed to MMI in utero were confirmed hypothyroid, with a significant increase in thyroid gland size, goitrous thyroid histology, and dramatically suppressed thyroid hormone in serum. In dams, no differences in temporal measurements of average daily gain, thyroid hormone, or rectal temperatures relative to controls suggests that MMI had little effect on maternal physiology. However, fetuses from MMI-treated gilts exhibited significant increases in body mass, girth, and vital organ weights, but no differences in crown-rump length or bone measurements suggesting non-allometric growth. The PLC and END showed a compensatory decrease in expression of inactivating deiodinase (DIO3). Similar compensatory gene expression was observed in fetal KID and LVR with a downregulation of all deiodinases (DIO1, DIO2, DIO3). Minor alterations in the expression of thyroid hormone transporters (SLC16A2 and SLC16A10) were observed in PLC, KID, and LVR.

We used multinomial logistic regression to estimate the association between fluoride exposure and classification of either subclinical or primary hypothyroidism and considered maternal thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) status, a marker of autoimmune hypothyroidism, as an effect modifier. In a subsample of 466 mother-child pairs, we used linear regression to explore the association between maternal hypothyroidism and child Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ) at ages 3-to-4 years and tested for effect modification by child sex.
A 0.5 mg/L increase in drinking water fluoride concentration was associated with a 1.65 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.04, 2.60) increased odds of primary hypothyroidism. In contrast, we did not find a significant association between urinary fluoride (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.00; 95%CI: 0.73, 1.39) or fluoride intake (aOR: 1.25; 95%CI: 0.99, 1.57) and hypothyroidism. Among women with normal TPOAb levels, the risk of primary hypothyroidism increased with both increasing water fluoride and fluoride intake (aOR water fluoride concentration: 2.85; 95%CI: 1.25, 6.50; aOR fluoride intake: 1.75; 95%CI: 1.27, 2.41). Children born to women with primary hypothyroidism had lower FSIQ scores compared to children of euthyroid women, especially among boys (B coefficient: -8.42; 95 % CI: -15.33, -1.50).
Fluoride in drinking water was associated with increased risk of hypothyroidism in pregnant women. Thyroid disruption may contribute to developmental neurotoxicity of fluoride."

Fifty-six adult hypothyroid patients were recruited to this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial. The intervention was 10 weeks of synbiotic (500 mg of 109 CFU/g probiotics plus fructo-oligosaccharide, n = 28) compared to placebo (lactose, magnesium stearate, talc, and silicon dioxide, n = 28). Randomization and allocation to trial groups were carried out using random number sequences drawn from https://sealedenvelope.com/. Primary outcomes were serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4), and secondary outcomes were depression, quality of life, and blood pressure (BP). P-values< 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Analysis on 51 patients who completed the trial showed that TSH and depression (p> 0.05) did not change significantly, while serum FT4 significantly increased in both groups (p = 0.03 and p = 0.02 in symbiotic and placebo respectively). A significant decrease in systolic BP occurred only in the synbiotic group (p = 0.05). Significant improvements occurred regarding different domains and areas of quality of life in the crude and adjusted analysis, including perceived mental health (p = 0.02), bodily pain (p = 0.02), general health perception (p = 0.002), and wellbeing (p = 0.002), which were significantly higher in the synbiotic group.
Ten-week supplementation with synbiotic had no favorable effect on depression and TSH, but it improved blood pressure and quality of life in patients with hypothyroidism. More trials are needed to support or reject these findings.

This paper proposes ILSHIP, an interpretable predictive model for hypothyroidism, to reduce its diagnostic complexity as well as improve the predictive performance and interpretability of existing models. First, the ILSHIP prediction model was built based on label encoding, missing value processing, feature selection, and data enhancement of the dataset. Second, the comprehensive performance of ILSHIP was compared with twelve existing related study models and eleven mainstream models, such as XGBoost and MLP. The experimental results showed that, based on the optimal hyperparameters the ILSHIP model can achieve 99.392%, 99.437%, 99.348%, 99.381%, and 99.960% in accuracy, recall, specificity, F1, and AUC, respectively. The accuracy of the ILSHIP model was about 0.7%-15.4% higher than the existing models. By introducing the SHAP framework into the ILSHIP model, important features affecting hypothyroidism such as thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxine index (FTI) were also identified, and the influencing factors for different individuals were finally analyzed to provide a basis for medical personnel to monitor the condition."

For example, thyroid deficiency disrupts the ovarian microarchitecture and menstrual cycle in neonate and adult women, respectively. Therefore, it is conceivable that thyroid deficiency might disrupt sexual maturation during the peri-pubertal period. To investigate the impact of radioactive iodine-induced thyroid deficiency on reproductive organs throughout puberty, immature female rats were given water containing radioactive iodine (0.37 MBq/g body weight) twice, on postnatal days 22 and 29. Radioactive iodine-induced hypothyroidism was revealed by low free thyroxin levels. Thyroid deficiency delayed the onset of vaginal opening, reduced ovarian weight and the number of medium-sized follicles and led to elongated uteri. However, there was no effect on the estrous cycle or absolute uterus weight. We conclude that radioactive iodine-induced thyroid deficiency delays sexual maturation and alters normal ovarian growth in peri-pubertal rats."

Poor adherence was suspected based on previous laboratory investigations. A low dose thyroxine absorption test using 400 µg of levothyroxine taken orally was performed. FT4 increased by 4.7 pmol/L at 3 hours and 6.6 pmol/L at 5 hours, following ingestion, effectively ruling out malabsorption. Her cardiac hemodynamic profile, measured noninvasively, also improved following levothyroxine intake, further supporting our diagnosis. Poor adherence was successfully managed by implementing twice weekly visits by a registered nurse and an improvement in both thyroid function tests and cardiac parameters was seen at the one-month follow-up visit. We suggest using a lower dose thyroxine absorption test, owing to its efficacy in establishing diagnosis and a safer alternative compared to higher doses in particular in high-risk cardiac patients."

Thyroid profiles (total thyroxine (TT4), thyrotropin (thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)), and thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAA)) collected as part of a breed surveillance program in Eurasians (2009-2017) were retrospectively analyzed. The study included data from 1,501 Eurasians from a German breeding club. Classification was exclusively based on laboratory data. Hypothyroidism was defined as a combined decrease in TT4 and increase in TSH in serum and was classified as TgAA-positive and TgAA-negative hypothyroidism. Thyroglobulin autoantibodies (TgAA) independent of the concentrations of TT4 and TSH were determined. The overall prevalence of hypothyroidism, TgAA-positive hypothyroidism, TgAA-negative hypothyroidism and TgAA-positivity was assessed when the dogs entered the program. Follow-up laboratory data was available for 324 dogs without hypothyroidism on initial examination.
The initial screening was performed at a median age of 18 months (interquartile range (IQR): 15-29). The overall prevalence of hypothyroidism was 3.9% (n = 58; 95% CI: 2.9-4.8%) and the prevalence of a positive TgAA status was 7.9% (n = 118; 95% CI: 6.6-9.3%). The prevalence of TgAA-positive and TgAA-negative hypothyroidism was 1.7% (n = 26; 95% CI: 1.1-2.4%) and 2.1% (n = 32; 95% CI: 1.4-2.9%), respectively. 22.0% of dogs with positive TgAA status (26/118) were already hypothyroid on initial examination. Overall, 42.5% (17/40) of TgAA-positive dogs on initial examination developed hypothyroidism on follow-up.
The results of this study demonstrate that the Eurasian dog breed exhibits a relevant risk for hypothyroidism and presence of TgAA. The predictive value of TgAA for hypothyroidism or developing hypothyroidism was high in this breed. Further investigations with longitudinal studies in individual dogs are warranted."

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study employing a convenient sampling technique, conducted between February and May 2022. A questionnaire was distributed online to all participants in all five regions. Results: In this survey, a total of 2016 Saudi citizens participated. When asked about depression, more than half of the participants (59.6%) correctly identified depression as one of the neuropsychiatric clinical symptoms of hypothyroidism. Nearly half of the participants (47.5%) were unaware that anxiety was not a neuropsychiatric manifestation of hypothyroidism. With a percentage of 91.0%, the majority of participants exhibited poor knowledge. The regression analysis showed that males have significantly reduced knowledge about hypothyroidism than females (coefficient −3.686, p-value < 0.0001). Similarly, those who have “enough income and can save” were more knowledgeable than others (coefficient 0.731, p-value < 0.02). Regarding the source of information, journals provide three times more information (p-value 0.0001), and healthcare practitioners provides four times more information as compared to family and friends (p-value 0.0001).

Cerebellar neuronal apoptosis and motor deficits are crucial events in hypothyroidism; however, the underlying mechanism is less-known. Using a methimazole-treated hypothyroidism rat model, we investigated cerebellar autophagy, growth factor, and apoptotic mechanisms that participate in motor functions. We first identified that methimazole up-regulated cerebellar autophagy, marked by enhanced LC3B-II, Beclin-1, ATG7, ATG5-12, p-AMPKα/AMPKα, and p62 degradation as well as reduced p-AKT/AKT, p-mTOR/mTOR, and p-ULK1/ULK1 in developing and young adult rats. We probed upstream effectors of this abnormal autophagy and detected a methimazole-induced reduction in cerebellar phospho-epidermal growth factor receptor (p-EGFR)/EGFR and heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF). Here, while a thyroxine-induced TH replenishment alleviated autophagy process and restored HB-EGF/EGFR, HB-EGF treatment regulated AKT-mTOR and autophagy signaling in the cerebellum. Moreover, neurons of the rat cerebellum demonstrated this reduced HB-EGF-dependent increased autophagy in hypothyroidism. We further checked whether the above events were related to cerebellar neuronal apoptosis and motor functions. We detected that comparable to thyroxine, treatment with HB-EGF or autophagy inhibitor, 3-MA, reduced methimazole-induced decrease in Nissl staining and increase in c-Caspase-3 and TUNEL-+ve apoptotic count of cerebellar neurons. Additionally, 3-MA, HB-EGF, and thyroxine attenuated the methimazole-induced diminution in riding time on rota-rod and grip strength for the motor performance of rats. Overall, our study enlightens HB-EGF/EGFR-dependent autophagy mechanism as a key to cerebellar neuronal loss and functional impairments in developmental hypothyroidism, which may be inhibited by HB-EGF and 3-MA treatments, like thyroxine."

Patients with reduced GFR have higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, which might be increased in the presence of hypothyroidism. A thyroid function test is not routinely included in predialysis workups. Aim The aim was to explore the prevalence of hypothyroidism among hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients at a single large center in Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia. Methods A chart-review cross-sectional study was conducted at Al Jabr Kidney Center from February to May 2022. It included adult patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Data was extracted through a pre-structured data extraction sheet to avoid data collection errors. Extracted data included the patient's demographic data, causes of renal failure, and comorbidities besides laboratory investigations and thyroid profile. Results A total of 99 patients were included, with their ages ranging from 15 to 89 years, with a mean age of 51.3 ± 16.9 years old. The exact 76 (76.8%) patients were males. Exact five (5.1%) patients had high thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), nine (9.1%) had low TSH, and 85 (85.9%) were euthyroid.

Presentation of pericardial effusion of any etiology can range from being asymptomatic to hemodynamic instability with cardiac tamponade, depending on the amount and speed of accumulation of pericardial fluid, but pericardial effusion associated with hypothyroidism are usually small. Protracted medication non-adherence was a key factor in our patient's presentation. CASE REPORT We present a case of a woman in her 40s with a known history of autoimmune hypothyroidism with medication non-adherence for longer than 9 months who presented with fatigue, weight gain, limited physical activity, and exertional dyspnea with bilateral swelling of the upper and lower extremities. Examination revealed muffled heart sounds, positive JVD, and positive pulsus paradoxus. She had an elevated TSH, low free T4, and a high anti-thyroid peroxidase antibody level. Echocardiography revealed a large pericardial effusion with impending tamponade. Pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain was done and the patient's symptoms resolved quickly. The patient was restarted on a prior dose of levothyroxine 175 mcg. She had improved by the 3rd day of hospitalization; the pericardial drain was removed, and she was discharged with access to medication. Follow-up revealed complete resolution of her symptoms. CONCLUSIONS This case emphasizes the importance of recognition of hypothyroidism as the etiology of life-threatening large pericardial effusions, as it is treatable and recurrences are preventable. To prevent recurrence, it is important to achieve euthyroidism after treating an episode of pericardial effusion."

There are multiple possible causes of poor control of hypothyroidism, including narrow LT4 therapeutic index, food and drug interactions, comorbidities, and patient non-adherence. Some of these obstacles could possibly be overcome with the novel liquid LT4 formulation. Liquid LT4 reaches maximum blood concentration about 30 minutes faster than the tablet form. Faster pharmacokinetics might lead to more efficient LT4 absorption, as suggested by a recent real-world study in patients with primary and central hypothyroidism. Liquid LT4 treatment led to increased free thyroxine (FT4) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) with decreased low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration and substantially improved quality of life for the patients. Herein we present a series of 31 patients with hypothyroidism of different aetiologies treated with the novel liquid LT4 formulation in standard clinical care in light of the latest scientific publications on liquid LT4 formula. We observed normalization of thyroid function tests shortly after introduction of liquid LT4, irrespective of concurrent diseases or concomitant medications that could diminish LT4 absorption. In more detail, the treatment with liquid LT4 managed to normalize thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations in patients without any known causes of LT4 absorption disturbances, as well as in those with malabsorption: with gastric bypass, partial small and large intestine resection, scleroderma, gluten intolerance, celiac disease, atrophic gastritis, and polytherapy.

We evaluated the practice of performing a routine thyroid function test around 2 weeks of age in all healthy full-term infants (≥37 weeks gestation) born to women with hypothyroidism to identify thyroid dysfunction.
This retrospective, observational single centre study included full-term infants born to women with hypothyroidism, including non-Graves' autoimmune hypothyroidism, over a 3-year period. Preterm infants and those born to women with Graves' disease or thyroidectomy were excluded.
Of the 790 mother-infant dyads, 780 infants (99%) had normal thyroid function. Only 10 infants (1%) had thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels > 10mIU/L at 2 weeks of age (range 10.25-106.37 mU/L). Of these, follow-up thyroid function normalized in nine infants within 2 weeks. A routine newborn screening test identified congenital hypothyroidism in one infant. No infant born to women with known presence of anti-thyroid antibodies had TSH levels > 10 mIU/L. Thyroid function was normal for most infants where maternal anti-thyroid antibodies were not known (125/133, 94%).
Infants born to women with hypothyroidism (including autoimmune hypothyroidism) had normal thyroid function in the early neonatal period. A small proportion of infants may develop TSH levels > 10 mU/L that normalizes by 4 weeks of age. The practice of routine thyroid function testing for this cohort in addition to newborn screening test offers no additional benefit."

Its clinical symptoms include systemic manifestations related mainly, but not solely, to thyroid hormone deficiency. The bioimpedance phase angle (PhA) is a reliable indicator of nutritional as well as cellular health status. PhA is decreased not only in malnutrition, but also in many inflammatory diseases. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between HT and PhA score.
In this cross-sectional study, we compared the anthropometric, laboratory and body composition parameters of 49 women with HT and 98 propensity-score-matched women without thyroid disease.
Females with HT had significantly lower PhA scores (5.78 ± 0.43) compared to women without a thyroid disorder (5.98 ± 0.49, 
Decreased PhA scores in patients with HT may indicate that the inflammatory process in this autoimmune disease has an influence on cellular health and on the function of the entire body. Such an association was not found in women with non-HT hypothyroidism."

In this study, we detected three novel variants in PAX8 (c.149A > C and c.329G > A) and NKX2-1 (c.706A > G) by whole exome sequencing (WES) in three unrelated CH patients with variable phenotypes. The results of Western blot and immunofluorescence analysis showed that the three variants had no effect on protein expression and subcellular localization. However, the results of the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and dual-luciferase reporter assay suggested that the three variants in PAX8 and NKX2-1 both affected their DNA-binding ability and reduced their transactivation capacity. Moreover, a dominant-negative effect in K236E−NKX2-1 was identified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. To sum up, our findings extend our knowledge of the current mutation spectrum of PAX8 and NKX2-1 and provide important information for diagnosing, treating, and preventing CH in these families."

So, this study aimed to assess the incidence of hypothyroidism after therapeutic external beam radiotherapy to the neck and to determine the time for the development of hypothyroidism. Methodology A non-randomized prospective comparative study was done at a tertiary care center from April 2018 to September 2020. Any cancer patients who were euthyroid before radiotherapy and are planned to receive EBRT to the neck were included as cases, whereas controls were selected from the patients who were euthyroid before radiotherapy and were planned to receive EBRT to the site other than the neck. A total of 100 participants in each case and control group were selected. Data were collected on participants' age, gender, primary tumor site, treatment modality, total radiation dose along with concurrent chemoradiation regimens. Details of blood chemistry including thyroid hormone levels were collected during the pre-radiation phase and post-radiation phase. After the completion of radiotherapy, both the patients and controls were followed up periodically at three months, six months, nine months, 12 months, and finally at 15 months post-radiation. Data were analyzed and interpreted to pursue defined objectives by using tables and graphs using Microsoft Excel and IBM SPSS, version 26.0 (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). The chi-square test was applied to find out the association of different variables with the development of hypothyroidism. P-values<0.05 were considered significant throughout. Results According to our findings, the incidence of hypothyroidism following external beam radiotherapy to the neck where radiation portals included a portion or the entire thyroid gland was 16% and 4%, when the radiation given to sites other than neck region. The difference in incidence between the case and control groups was found to be statically significant (p<0.05). However, it was found that age, gender, the primary tumor site, total radiation dose, and treatment modality had no significant effects on hypothyroidism development. The median time duration to become hypothyroid after EBRT was 12 months. Conclusions The monitoring of thyroid function should become a part of routine follow-up procedures in all cancer patients who receive neck radiation as part of their treatment."

This produces the thyroid hormones T3 and T4 that are responsible for carrying out the normal functions of the physical body, that is, changes in the secretion of these hormones may be related to some maladjustments in the stomatognathic system. The most common manifestations of congenital hypothyroidism, also known as cretinism, are thick lips, macroglossia, malocclusion and delayed eruption of both dentitions. This study aims to report a case of a child with hypothyroidism and a delay in the chronology of tooth eruption. Patient, female, 9 years and 8 months old, whose main complaint was a delay in the chronology of tooth eruption. On clinical examination, a marked delay in the chronology of tooth eruption was observed. Therefore, it was necessary to refer the patient to a geneticist, who ruled out any syndromic alteration. Then, the patient was referred to the endocrinologist, whose opinion was hypothyroidism. "

The present study aimed to reveal the potential deteriorations that may occur in the initial period of sensory processing in resting electroencephalography between children with subclinical hypothyroidism and a control group.
Electroencephalographies of 15 children with subclinical hypothyroidism and 15 healthy children aged 10 to 17 years were recorded for 2 minutes for EC and 2 minutes for eyes-open conditions in resting state. Absolute electroencephalography band powers (μV2 ) within the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands were calculated in Fz, Cz, Pz, and Oz electrodes, respectively, for eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions.
The results show that, although there was no noteworthy difference between the powers of the electroencephalography frequency bands of children with subclinical hypothyroidism and healthy children during the eyes-open condition, the alpha powers of the control group were significantly higher in all electrodes during the eyes-closed condition. Furthermore, the powers of all frequency bands were observed to decrease in the eyes-open condition in the control group. However, the same net decrease was not observed in the frequency powers of children with subclinical hypothyroidism.
According to the results of this study, children with subclinical hypothyroidism may experience information processing impairments starting in the early stages of sensory processing."

Hundred clinical hypothyroid patients, 110 subclinical hypothyroid patients, and 95 healthy controls were enrolled. Gene expression analysis and genotyping were performed by qPCR. LAIR-2 protein, a proinflammatory mediator, was tested by ELISA. Serum LncRNA-PAX8-AS1 was downregulated, whereas LAIR-2 mRNA and protein levels were upregulated in clinical and subclinical hypothyroid patients compared to healthy controls. LncRNA-PAX8-AS1 rs4848320 and rs1110839 were associated with increased risk of clinical hypothyroidism. Interestingly, both SNPs were associated with differential expression of serum LncRNA-PAX8-AS1 among clinical hypothyroid patients. LAIR-2 rs2287828 was associated with elevated risk of both clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism. Harboring the rs2287828 T allele augmented the LAIR-2 mRNA expression among clinical hypothyroid patients, while elevated both LAIR-2 mRNA and protein levels in subclinical hypothyroid patients. The rs4848320-rs1110839-rs2287828 TTT, CTT, and CGT haplotypes were associated with increased hypothyroid risk. Surprisingly, serum LncRNA-PAX8-AS1 and LAIR-2 mRNA expression demonstrated superior diagnostic accuracy for clinical hypothyroidism and turned out as independent predictors in the multivariate analysis. Conclusively, LncRNA-PAX8-AS1 and LAIR-2 genetic variants are novel genetic biomarkers of hypothyroidism that could alter the LncRNA-PAX8-AS1 and LAIR-2 expression. LncRNA-PAX8-AS1 and LAIR-2 expression profiles have the potential as effective diagnostic and prognostic indicators of hypothyroidism."

With a normal ejection fraction on echocardiography, an electrocardiogram revealed complete atrioventricular block. When she was admitted, her laboratory testing showed that she had severely raised Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) levels, severe dyslipidemia with normal electrolytes, and normal liver and kidney function tests. The patient was treated with 50mg Thyroxine to her. She had significant improvement within two weeks of treatment. Up on the next follow-up (at one-month), her electrocardiogram returned to normal sinus rhythm without any evidence of atrioventricular block and that the lipid profile had returned to normal.
In its first stages, hypothyroidism can not show any obvious symptoms. Untreated hypothyroidism over time can lead to a variety of health issues, including obesity, joint discomfort, infertility, and heart disease. This current case demonstrates how levothyroxine medication successfully managed a young female patient's severe hypothyroidism, difficult total heart block, severe hyperlipidemia, and long-standing menstrual irregularity.

Our first case demonstrates that a patient with large pericardial effusion can be managed conservatively with aggressive thyroid hormone replacement therapy. In our second case, pericardiocentesis was performed in addition to thyroid hormone replacement therapy as the underlying aetiology of effusion could not be reasonably limited to hypothyroidism.

Regarding the well-known effects of choline on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the study examined the effects of choline on hippocampal BDNF gene expression in maternal hypothyroidism rats.
To induce the hypothyroidism, 6-propyl-2-thiouracil was introduced to the ingesting water from the sixth day of gestation to twenty-first postnatal day (PND). Choline-treatment started twice a day on the first day of gestation until PND 21. On PND28, pups were sacrificed. The expression of BDNF gene was evaluated after the hippocampus was harvested. Our results demonstrated that both male and female pre-pubertal offspring rats' BDNF gene expression was decreased by developmental hypothyroidism. Choline increases the ratio of relative gene expression of BDNF in the hippocampus of males and females in the control/hypothyroidism group, especially in males.
It can be concluded that maternal choline supplementation on the first day of gestation until PND 21 improves brain development and cognitive function in pre-pubertal offspring rats regarding control/hypothyroidism groups."

A total of four patients from two non-consanguineous families with marked alteration of TG synthesis were studied. The two families were previously analysed in our laboratory, only one deleterious allele, in each one, was detected after sequencing the TG gene (c.2359 C > T [p.Arg787*], c.5560 G > T [p.Glu1854*]). These findings were confirmed in the present studies by Next-Generation Sequencing. The single nucleotide coding variants of the TG gene were then analyzed to predict the possible variant causing the disease. The p.Pro2232Leu (c.6695 C > T), identified in both families, showing a low frequency population in gnomAD v2.1.1 database and protein homology, amino acid prediction, and 3D modeling analysis predict a potential pathogenic effect of this variant. We also transiently express p.Pro2232Leu in a full-length rat TG cDNA clone and confirmed that this point variant was sufficient to cause intracellular retention of mutant TG in HEK293T cells. Consequently, each family carried a compound heterozygous for p.Arg787*/p.Pro2232Leu or p.Glu1854*/p.Pro2232Leu variants. In conclusion, our results confirm the pathophysiological importance of altered TG folding as a consequence of missense variants located in the ChEL domain of TG."

Using a cross-sectional design, we recruited a total of 1718 outpatients with treatment-naïve MDD. Demographic and relevant clinical information including duration of MDD, severity of depression and anxiety, psychotic symptoms, suicide attempts, thyroid function parameters, etc. were collected. According to thyroid function parameters, patients were classified as AIT, NAIH, latent Hashimoto's thyroiditis (LH) and euthyroidism (ET).
Patients with SCH (including AIT and NAIH) had older age at onset, and were more likely to have psychotic symptoms compared to those with ET. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that SCH was associated with duration of MDD and HAMD scores. Logistic regression analysis showed that the odds of having more severe anxiety and metabolic syndrome were greater among patients with SCH compared to those with ET. The odds of having suicide attempts were greater among patients with AIT than among those with ET.
Because of the cross-sectional design of this study, we were unable to sort out causality between MDD and SCH.

The response of CRT was defined as a relative increase (≥15%) or absolute increase (≥10%) in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from implantation to one-year after follow-up.
Diabetes mellitus, atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease ratios were similar between responder vs. non-responder groups. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels were higher (p <0.005) in non-responder group. Responder group had higher baseline LVEF (p <0.001), and follow-up LVEF (p <0.001) and longer baseline QRS interval (p =0.004), but similar post-implant QRS interval duration (p >0.005) with non-responder group. Baseline QRS interval (p =0.002), baseline LVEF (p <0.001) and the presence of subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) (p =0.001) were independent predictors of CRT response. Adding SCH as a risk factor to our baseline risk modelling has an independent prognostic impact to predict non-responder patients (p =0.01).
Presence of the SCH may be an important predictor of non-response in patients undergoing CRT. Evaluating the risk factors associated with non-response to CRT may be logical in identifying patients who obtain maximum benefit from CRT treatment."

Levothyroxine Sodium is approved to treat Hypothyroidisim, to suppress thyroid hormone release from cancerous thyroid nodules, and to prevent the growth of goiters. In addition, it is also used to treat conditions such as myxedema, cretinism, and obesity.
This assessment highlights the overview of the recent patents of Levothyroxine Sodium. This review includes patents grouped in sections like product patents, process patents, and composition-related patents, along with the treatment methodology. The objective of this article is to impel pseudoscientists to all existing patents in a solitary place.
Data were gathered from various internet-based resources, including Patentscope ® (WIPO), Worldwide Espacenet® (EPO), Google Patents, and InPASS (Indian patent database).
Several new processes and composition-related patents of Levothyroxine Sodium have been reported. Further, due to the problem of photosensitivity, oxidation during development, and stability of Levothyroxine Sodium formulation, several excipients are tried in these patents to stabilize the same. However, the formulation of Levothyroxine Sodium with better characteristics needs to be developed.
Extensive exposure has been carried out towards various processes for the preparation of Levothyroxine Sodium and the composition of the same. This sort of dynamic exploration will clear the path for many generic players, which will lead to the reduction of the expense of the composition and accordingly enhance global health care at a less expensive cost."

This study is intended to evaluate the relationship between SCH and blood lipid profiles using well defined diagnostic criteria.
Data from 11,512 physical examinees in our hospital who had finished two tests with an interval of at least 3 months were analyzed, including 685 cases of SCH as stipulated in this study. In addition to common physical examination indicators, other parameters such as thyroid function indices and blood lipids were measured twice with an interval of at least 3 months. Subjects were diagnosed with SCH only when their levels of TT3, TT4, FT3 and FT4 were normal and TSH levels were increased on both tests, which meant these subjects were in a state of SCH for at least 3 months. The results of blood lipids for the second time were analyzed.
Statistically significant differences were found in age, sex, BMI, hemoglobin, total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein (HDL-C), and BFP between the SCH and control groups (P < 0.001). However, there were no statistically significant differences in age, sex, blood pressure, blood lipids, blood glucose or BMI between patients with mild SCH and those with severe SCH (P > 0.05). After balancing the age and sex ratio, no factors were confirmed to be statistically significant independent factors of SCH. None of the parameters showed statistically significant differences between patients with mild SCH and those with severe SCH (P > 0.05).
After defining rigorous criteria for the diagnosis of SCH, no definite association between SCH and TC, LDL-C or HDL-C was confirmed in this study. SCH may have no relationship to the most concerning blood lipid profile."

A decision-analytic model was developed to estimate and compare the long-term (80 years) costs and health effects of newborn screening for PKU and congenital hypothyroidism. Data were obtained from the literature and translated to Swedish conditions. A societal perspective was taken, including costs falling on health care providers, municipal care and services, as well as production loss due to morbidity.
Screening 100 000 newborns for PKU resulted in 73 gained quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) compared with no screening. When adding congenital hypothyroidism, the number of gained QALYs was 232 compared with PKU alone, adding up to a total of 305 QALYs gained. Corresponding cost estimates were $80.8, $70.3, and $10.05 million USD for no screening, PKU screening, and PKU plus congenital hypothyroidism screening, respectively, indicating that screening for PKU plus congenital hypothyroidism was more effective and less costly compared with the other strategies. The majority of cost savings with PKU plus congenital hypothyroidism screening was due to reductions in productivity losses and municipal care and services costs.
The Swedish newborn screening program for PKU and congenital hypothyroidism saves substantial costs for society while generating additional QALYs, emphasizing the importance of public investments in early diagnosis and treatment."

In both the cervical and lumbar spine, patients with hypothyroidism are at increased risk of postoperative medical complications. Consequently, patients with hypothyroidism experience increased healthcare costs and readmission rates. However, there are some contradictory findings with some studies suggesting that hypothyroidism may have a protective effect in patients undergoing lumbar fusion, specifically against postoperative myocardial infraction and decreased inpatient mortality. When examining spine surgery outcomes, there are mixed results when considering the effect of hypothyroidism.

The initial LT4 dose recommendation has increased over decades. We evaluated whether the increased LT4 dosing influenced thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine (fT4) concentrations, growth, or treatment-related symptoms.
LT4 doses, TSH, fT4, anthropometrics, and treatment-related symptoms until age 2 years were evaluated in 172 Finnish CH patients born between 1980 and 2018. The patients were grouped according to birth decade: 1980s (n = 19, mean LT4 starting dose 6.8 μg/kg/day), 1990s (n = 50, 7.4 μg/kg/day), 2000s (n = 59, 9.7 μg/kg/day), and 2010s (n = 44, 10.8 μg/kg/day).
TSH concentrations were higher during the first 2 years of life in children born in the 1980s compared to children born later. TSH concentrations were often subnormal in children receiving higher LT4 doses (children born in the 2000s and 2010s). However, symptoms of overtreatment were uncommon. Linear or head growth showed no differences between the groups during the first 2 years of life. Although growth was within the normal spectrum, children in all groups were shorter than their target length at 2 years and their weight-for-length was above the mean through the first 2 years of life.
Current treatment practice with higher LT4 dose normalizes TSH rapidly without significant increase in side effects. However, irrespective of initial LT4 dose, children were shorter than expected at 2 years of age. Effects of different initial LT4 dose on cognitive development urges further investigation."

However, to the best of our knowledge, no study to date has examined the risk factors for hypothyroidism specifically after definitive radiotherapy in patients with early glottic carcinoma. The present study determined risk factors for hypothyroidism after definitive radiotherapy in patients with early glottic carcinoma. This was a retrospective study that included 73 patients with T1 or T2, N0 glottic squamous cell carcinoma who underwent radiotherapy between June 3, 2009 and December 25, 2020. Demographic and clinical characteristics, including age, sex, tumor stage and pretreatment thyroid volume, were examined to elucidate the clinical risk factors for hypothyroidism. Field size, total prescribed dose and thyroid receiving dose were evaluated as dosimetric risk factors for hypothyroidism. Irradiated underlying thyroid volumes of more than 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 65 Gy (V5Gy, V10Gy, V20Gy, V30Gy, V40Gy, V50Gy, V60Gy and V65Gy) and mean thyroid dose were included as thyroid receiving doses. The median follow-up duration was 61 months (range, 7-150 months). Hypothyroidism was present in 15 (21%) of the 73 patients, including 12 and 3 patients with grade 1 and 2 hypothyroidism, respectively. Among the demographic and clinical factors, sex and pretreatment thyroid volume were significantly associated with hypothyroidism (P=0.007 and P<0.001, respectively). Among the dosimetric factors, the presence of hypothyroidism was significantly associated with V5Gy (P=0.012), V10Gy (P=0.015), V20Gy (P=0.020), V30Gy (P=0.024), V40Gy (P=0.028), V50Gy (P=0.028), V60Gy (P=0.027) and mean thyroid dose (P=0.023). In conclusion, sex, pretreatment thyroid volume and thyroid receiving dose were associated with hypothyroidism after definitive radiotherapy in patients with early glottic carcinoma. Particularly, the receiving dose to the thyroid gland should be reduced in female patients and in those with small thyroid volumes who are at higher risk for hypothyroidism following radiotherapy."

This cross-sectional study aimed to determine the prevalence of hypothyroidism among patients with OSA, and the characteristics and predictors of hypothyroidism associated with OSA.
A total of 573 patients with OSA were included in the study. Serum levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4) were measured in all participants. Univariate and binary logistic regression analysis were performed to assess the association of OSA with hypothyroidism while controlling for potential confounders. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to evaluate the OSA effect in the distinction between euthyroid and hypothyroidism.
The prevalence of hypothyroidism was 6.75%、5.12%、10.38% in the total, men, and women cohort, respectively, and the prevalence rate in women OSA patients was significantly higher than that in men OSA patients (P=0.018). The men OSA patients with hypothyroidism had a higher Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) than women OSA patients with hypothyroidism (P=0.022). Additionally, the ESS was significantly higher in men OSA patients with hypothyroidism than those with euthyroid (P=0.042), while women OSA patients had no such difference (P=0.822). In men patients with OSA, ROC curve analyses revealed that the risk of hypothyroidism increased in accordance with increasing ESS after adjustment for potential confounders, and the optimal cutoff value was 10 score. Higher ESS category was significantly associated with a higher risk of prevalent hypothyroidism in men patients with OSA [odds ratio (OR) = 4.898 for ESS≥10 relative to ESS <10, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.628-14.731, P = 0.005].

The present prospective cohort study has been conducted to evaluate the effect of levothyroxine on serum adiponectin, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular risk in patients with clinical hypothyroidism. Methods Sixty patients with clinical hypothyroidism who were prescribed levothyroxine were recruited following selection criteria and changes in Zulewski's score, glycemic parameters, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI), lipid profile, serum adiponectin, serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), cardiovascular risk indices, and Framingham risk score were assessed 12 weeks post-levothyroxine therapy. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was done to detect the cut-off for adiponectin levels to differentiate between responders and non-responders. Neural network models were created to predict the risk of cardiovascular morbidity. Results Post-levothyroxine therapy, there was a significant improvement in body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.025), diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.021), Zulewski's score (p < 0.001), serum insulin (p = 0.005), fasting sugar (p < 0.001), serum adiponectin (p < 0.001), thyroid profile (p < 0.001), total cholesterol (p < 0.001), low-density lipoprotein (p < 0.001), high-density lipoprotein (p = 0.007), triglycerides (p = 0.002), and subcutaneous fat (p = 0.015). Serum adiponectin showed significant improvement in hypothyroid patients compared to euthyroid individuals (mean difference: -2.21; 95% CI: -2.52 to -1.91; p < 0.001). Mean difference in insulin resistance (HOMA-IR: 0.3, p < 0.001; QUICKI: -0.002, p < 0.001) and cardiovascular risk (atherogenic index: 0.12, p = 0.04; coronary risk index: 0.14, p = 0.038; Framingham risk score: 0.65, p = 0.041) also showed improvement. Serum adiponectin and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were directly correlated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk scores. Conclusion The reduced serum adiponectin level and increased cardiovascular risk in clinical hypothyroidism were improved with hormone replacement, and serum adiponectin level was found to be a good prognostic marker for the treatment response."

Moreover, abnormal lipid profiles, an insidious manifestation of SCH, show various impacts on different age groups. This study aimed to establish an age-specific TSH reference range to clarify the spectrum of SCH in the elderly. The prevalence of dyslipidemia and the age-specific association between TSH and lipid profiles were analyzed to elucidate the relationship between SCH and dyslipidemia. This cross-sectional study enrolled 2460 participants aged ≥ 65 years via cluster sampling. All participants received physical, laboratory tests and thyroid ultrasound examination and completed the questionnaire. The chi-square test was used to analyze variations of dyslipidemia prevalence among different groups. The Cochran-Armitage trend test was applied for testing the linear trends of age-specific prevalence of dyslipidemia among different TSH intervals in each age group. After adjusting for confounding factors, the age-specific association between TSH and lipid profiles was identified using multi-variate linear regression analysis. The TSH reference ranges in the 65-70 age group, 71-80 age group and > 80 age group were 0.65-5.51 mIU/L, 0.85-5.89 mIU/L and 0.78-6.70 mIU/L, respectively. Using these age-specific reference ranges, the prevalence of SCH in the whole population was 3.74%, which was significantly lower than the prevalence based on the laboratory reference range (10.28%). In the 65-70 age group, only the prevalence of high total cholesterol (TC) increased significantly with the age-specific TSH intervals, and TSH was positively associated with TC and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In the 71-80 and > 80 age groups, the prevalence of high TC, high triglycerides (TGs), and high LDL-C increased significantly with elevated TSH reference ranges. The levels of TC, TGs, and LDL-C were also positively associated with TSH level in 71-80 age group. However, such an association disappeared in > 80 age group. An age-specific reference range for TSH can effectively prevent the overdiagnosis of SCH in the elderly. Aging could somewhat attenuate the impact of TSH on lipid profiles."

No evidence supports the use of levothyroxine for treating SCH in CHF due to the lack of reliable and well-designed clinical trials.
CV outcome and dose-response trials are needed to understand better the role of levothyroxine replacement treatment for a safer prescription in this clinical setting."

The traditional treatment for hypothyroidism is thyroid hormone replacement therapy. The traditional treatments for hyperthyroidism include antithyroid drug, iodine radiotherapy, and surgery. Thyroid disease can be fatal in severe cases if untreated. Current statistical reference ranges used for diagnosis based on relevant biochemical parameters have been debated, and insufficient treatment can result in long-term thyroid hormone deficiency, which is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and persistent symptoms. In contrast, overtreatment can result in heart disease and osteoporosis, particularly in older people and pregnant women. Therefore, under- or over-treatment should be avoided and treatment regimens should be monitored closely. A significant proportion of patients who achieve biochemical treatment goals still complain of significant symptoms. Systematic literature review was performed through the Embase (Elsevier), PubMed and Web of Science databases, and studies summarized evidence regarding treatment and management of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, and reviewed clinical practice guidelines. We also reviewed the latest research on the metabolic mechanisms of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, which contributed to understanding of thyroid diseases in the clinic. A reliable algorithm is needed to management, assessment, and treatment patients with hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, which can not only improve management efficiency, but also providing a broad application. In addition, the thyroid disorder showed a lipid metabolism tissue specificity in the Ventromedial Hypothalamus, and effect oxidative stress and energy metabolism of whole body. This review summarizes an algorithm for thyroid disease and the latest pathogenesis that would be useful to generalist and subspecialty physicians and others providing care for patients with this condition."

We present five immunological AEs in a single patient treated with NIVO. A 68-year-old male patient with metastatic renal cell carcinoma and right-sided nephrectomy received NIVO after pazopanib and sunitinib treatment. Two and a half months after starting NIVO, hepatocellular enzymes and creatinine were elevated. Concomitantly, the patient noticed hypopigmentation of the hand skin and a change in voice and speech. Due to hepatitis, he has been treated with dexamethasone 16 mg daily for 22 days, after which hypothyroidism and increased creatine kinase were found without muscle pain and functional impairment. Dexamethasone was continued, and a rapid decline in all parameters except thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and vitiligo was observed. Myositis was initially considered a part of hypothyroidism and elevated renal parameters due to hypohydration. The rapid regression on glucocorticoid treatment and a longer time for creatinine normalization than expected with hydration were noticed. Nivolumab likely induced those side effects as assessed by Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale. The literature review shows that the consequences of PD-1 inhibition are not uniform. Side effects of checkpoint inhibitors should be monitored carefully in the early and later treatment schedules evaluating subclinical manifestations like myositis and worsening of kidney parameters.

An 86-year-old man with a diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, treated with oral alitretinoin 30 mg po daily, topical steroids, and ultraviolet light therapy presented to the emergency department with generalized weakness, decreased energy, orthostasis, and unexplained falls. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was 0.31 mIU/L (normal range: 0.4-4.4) from 1.93 before alitretinoin therapy, whereas free thyroxine was 5.7 pmol/L (normal range: 8-18) and the AM cortisol was 40 nmol/L (normal range: 120-535); these values were suggestive of central hypothyroidism and adrenal insufficiency. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) was not measured because of a laboratory error. Alitretinoin was stopped, and one dose of hydrocortisone 100mg IV was initiated, followed by maintenance doses of oral hydrocortisone 20mg qam and 10mg qpm. Levothyroxine (50μg ) daily was started 24 hours later. After stopping hydrocortisone for 24 hours, the AM cortisol and ACTH levels were 406 nmol/L and 2.18 pmol/L (normal range:1.6-13.9), respectively. He was discharged on thyroid hormone replacement therapy and glucocorticoids. Repeat thyroid function tests 6 weeks later showed a TSH of 0.4 mIU/L, and free thyroxine of 9.7 pmol/L.
Alitretinoin activates nuclear receptors called retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X-receptors. Retinoic acid receptors and retinoid X-receptors are widely expressed in the anterior pituitary gland. RXR-selective ligands such as retinoids can suppress TSH secretion, resulting in central hypothyroidism. Retinoids have also been shown to decrease ACTH secretion, which can result in central adrenal insufficiency.
Although central adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism have not been commonly reported in patients taking retinoids, they should always be considered when caring for these patients."

This study investigates how far the intake of L-T4 influences body composition, energy expenditure, respiratory quotient as well as strength, endurance and mobility in premenopausal women who suffer from subclinical hypothyroidism. Twenty-five women (27.36±5.77 years) with subclinical hypothyroidism were included in the study. The intake of levothyroxine was assumed. Subjects were examined immediately after study inclusion, after two months of levothyroxine use, and after TSH was fully adjusted to the reference range. In all measurements TSH, fT3 and fT4 were determined, body weight, body composition, energy expenditure and the respiratory quotient were measured, and a test battery was performed to identify strength, mobility and endurance capacity. TSH decreased from 5.95±0.99 μIU/ml at study inclusion to 1.2±0.33 μIU/ml after final trial. No change in weight, BMI, muscle mass, fat mass, energy expenditure and respiratory quotient was observed (p>0.05). A significant improvement in chest press (p=0.002), leg extension (p<0.001), right-hand grip strength (p=0.009) shoulder mobility (p<0.001), hip mobility (p=0.07), explosive strength (p=0.041) and the anaerobic threshold (p=0.13) was identified. Likewise, a non-significant (p=0.298) increase in left-hand grip strength could be detected.In summary, although levothyroxine does not positively affect body composition, energy expenditure and respiratory quotient, it can improve strength, mobility and endurance performance. For this reason, treatment with levothyroxine is recommended to improve exercise capacity in subclinical hypothyroidism."

Here, we used a well-validated methimazole-induced gestational hypothyroidism to investigate the behavioral consequences in offspring. Dams were treated with methimazole at 0.02% in drinking water up to gestational Day 9. Maternal body weights and maternal behavior were evaluated, and the puppies ware analyzed for weight gain and physical/behavioral development and assigned for the open field and fear conditioning test. Methimazole-induced gestational hypothyroidism induced loss in maternal and litter weight, increases in maternal behavior, and impairs in offspring developmental landmarks in both male and female rodents.

If identified early, treatment of OSA and associated hypothyroidism can be done timely to minimize the potential harmful complications of OSA on all aspects of the patient's health.
This study was done to find out the prevalence of OSA in hypothyroidism patients.
It was a cross-sectional study, done over a period of 1 year in a tertiary care hospital.

Out of 100 patients, who underwent polysomnography, 74 (74%) cases had OSA (AHI ≥5). Out of total 74 OSA cases, 29 (39.2%) cases had mild OSA (AHI 5-14), 15 (20.3%) cases had moderate OSA (AHI 15-30), and 30 (40.5%) cases had severe OSA. The age of the study population ranged between 24 and 78 years and the mean age was 58.28 ± 11.22 years. The mean age of the patients in the OSA group (59.27 ± 11.17 years) was higher than the non-OSA group (55.46 ± 11.09 years). Majority (64%) of our cases were male, and the proportion of males was found to be higher than females in both the groups (OSA/non-OSA). The body mass index (BMI) of the OSA group was found to be statistically higher as compared to that of the non-OSA group (P = 0.040). The BMI was found to be higher in severe OSA, but it was not statistically significant (P = 0.128). The mean value of FT4 was lower and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) was higher in the OSA group as compared with the non-OSA group. However, no significant association was found between FT4 and TSH values in both the groups. Out of 100 cases, 41 patients were treatment naïve with mean TSH value of 13.1 ± 7 and 59 were on treatment with mean TSH of 8.3 ± 4. Treatment-naïve patients had a statistically higher number (85.3%) of OSA cases in comparison to patients on treatment (66.1) (P = 0.030).
Prevalence of OSA is quite high in hypothyroidism. Patients with hypothyroidism should be screened for OSA for early diagnosis, especially in individuals with higher BMI. Treatment of hypothyroidism reduces the prevalence of OSA."

Most patients are treated with radiotherapy. Although post-radiotherapy hypothyroidism is a known complication, data regarding its incidence and factors influencing it are scarce. This study aimed to determine the incidence of post-radiotherapy hypothyroidism in head and neck carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy and the factors influencing it. Methodology Patients with head and neck carcinomas treated with radiotherapy as one of the modalities were included in this study. Thyroid function tests were done, and quality of life questionnaires were completed before treatment and during follow-up. Dose-volume histogram (DVH), demographic data, and disease-related parameters were compared. Results Out of the 95 patients screened, 14 were found to be hypothyroid prior to the commencement of radiotherapy and were excluded. With a median follow-up duration of 34 weeks, 29.6% developed hypothyroidism, with 19% developing it in the first year. On univariate and multivariate analysis of the DVH of the thyroid gland, volume receiving 50 Gy (V50), dose received to 50% volume (D50), and the mean dose (more than 50 Gy) were found to be significantly associated with hypothyroidism. Conclusions Hypothyroidism is a significant comorbid factor in Indian patients with head and neck carcinomas. The incidence of post-radiotherapy hypothyroidism is significant and occurs early compared to the western population leading to significant deterioration in the quality of life. Parameters such as the volume of the thyroid gland, V50, D50, and mean dose to the thyroid gland influence the incidence of hypothyroidism. The use of appropriate constraints can significantly prevent radiotherapy-induced hypothyroidism."

Building upon a previous cross-sectional study, the authors aimed to elucidate the causal relationship between long working hours and hypothyroidism through a longitudinal study.
Data were collected at baseline from 45,259 participants without thyroid disease and with consistent weekly working hours (36-40, 41-52, 53-60, and >60 hours) during the follow-up period. Hypothyroidism was defined using the reference limits of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone and free thyroxine levels. By estimating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, the risk of incident hypothyroidism was evaluated with 36-40 hours of work per week as the reference.
During 138,261.7 person-years of follow-up, 2,914 participants developed hypothyroidism (incidence density, 2.11/102 person-years). The multivariable-adjusted HRs of incident hypothyroidism for 41-52 hours, 53-60 hours, and >60 hours of work per week were 1.13 (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.24), 2.53 (95% CI, 2.17 to 2.95), and 2.57 (95% CI, 2.09 to 3.15), respectively. In dose-response analyses, long working hours had an approximately linear relationship with hypothyroidism incidence. The risk of incident hypothyroidism in those who worked 53-60 hours and >60 hours per week compared with the reference group was significantly higher among the older age group (≥36 years, stratified by median age), men, and daytime workers.

This study aimed to investigate the possible mechanism of Bushen Antai recipe (BAR) in the treatment of SH in early pregnancy and the relationship between SH during pregnancy and decidual cell pyroptosis through a rat model.
A total of 60 female rats were divided into control group, model group, levothyroxine (L-T4) group, low-dose BAR group (6 g/kg), medium-dose BAR group (12 g/kg), and high-dose BAR group (24 g/kg). The control group underwent pseudothyroidectomy, while the remaining groups established nonpregnant SH rat models. Except for the blank control group, rats were successfully established with SH models during pregnancy. The control group and the model group were treated with saline or BAR. The animals were sacrificed 12 hours after the last administration. The levels of serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT4), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-18 (IL-18) were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Western blot was used to detect the expression of decidual nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, Caspase-1, and porin family proteins.
There was no significant difference in serum FT4 among groups (P>0.05). Compared with the control group, serum TSH, IL-1β, IL-18, and NLRP3, Caspase-1, and gasdermin D (GSDMD) proteins in the decidua of the model group were significantly increased (P<0.05). Compared with the model group, the L-T4 group and the high-dose BAR group could significantly decrease the levels of serum TSH, IL-1β, IL-18, and NLRP3, Caspase-1, and GSDMD in decidual tissue (P<0.05). The medium dose of BAR could significantly decrease the levels of TSH, NLRP3, Caspase-1, and GSDMD (P<0.05), and the low dose group of BAR significantly decreased the levels of TSH, NLRP3, and GSDMD (P<0.05).

They have been categorized into three types, which are pigment stones, cholesterol stones, and mixed types of stones with varying incidence. The condition may be asymptomatic for significantly long durations and in most cases, the presence of gall stones is an incidental finding. The patients may present with pain in the abdomen in stages of cholecystitis or advanced stages or cases of gall stones causing the obstruction. Gallbladder stones are formed through a very complex procedure with the contribution of numerous factors, where the main initiating step is supposed to be the development of a state wherein there is supersaturation of the bile, which in turn gives rise to accumulation and stasis of the bile and the development of gall stones. One of the factors is said to be the hypothyroid state. Hypothyroidism itself is a significantly common endocrine disorder that affects almost every nucleated cell in the body. There is decreased efficacy of the thyroid gland. The serum T3 and T4 levels might be found on the lower side whereas thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) values are found to be high. In some of the cases, though the T3 and T4 levels are maintained within the normal limits, the TSH shows raised values, which are labeled as subclinical hypothyroidism. The state of hypothyroidism may act upon the amount of bile secretion, the flow of bile into the intestines, cholesterol metabolism, and the action of the sphincter of Oddi. Studies have shown results pointing towards the correlation between these two factors. The basic mechanism behind the correlation between cholelithiasis and hypothyroidism is supposed to be due to the action of the hypothyroid state on the functioning of the sphincter of Oddi. The hypothyroid state is supposed to be decreasing the tendency of the sphincter of Oddi to relax, thus causing stasis of the bile, which over time leads to initiation of supersaturation of the bile and formation of gall stones. Both subclinical hypothyroidism and clinical hypothyroidism are found to be significantly common in patients having cholelithiasis. We, in this review article, have taken into consideration various studies which have been performed regarding this topic worldwide. The studies have been performed on individuals who are already diagnosed with either of these diseases and are then screened for the presence of the other disease included in this study. The degree of correlation varies according to the location of the stones and their sizes. Though various studies show varying results to some extent, overall almost all the studies show significant pieces of evidence of the correlation between cholelithiasis and hypothyroidism."

Ninety eligible patients who underwent physical examination from March 2015 to September 2017 were selected. The levels of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-VD), free thyroxine (FT4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), and thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) were measured. The correlations of VitD level with those of thyroid function-related indices were analyzed.
The serum 25-OH-VD level was (17.82 ± 3.45) ng/mL in the 90 GDM patients in early pregnancy, including 64.44% patients in VitD deficiency group, 22.22% patients in VitD insufficiency group, and 13.33% in VitD sufficiency group. No significant differences in the levels of serum FT4, FT3, and TSH were found among different VitD groups (p > 0.05), but the level of TPOAb gradually decreased (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence rate of subclinical hypothyroidism among different VitD groups (p > 0.05). VitD level was not correlated with those of FT4, FT3, and TSH (p > 0.05), but negatively correlated with that of TPOAb (p < 0.05). An increase of TPOAb level raised the risk of VitD deficiency in pregnant women (p < 0.05). Patients suffered from significant 25-OH-VD deficiency in spring and winter (p < 0.05).
GDM patients in early pregnancy display VitD deficiency, and their serum 25-OH-VD level is affected by seasons and not significantly related to subclinical hypothyroidism. However, the increased level of TPOAb may raise the risk of VitD deficiency in pregnant women."

Factitious hypoglycemia (FH) is the deliberate use of insulin preparations or oral hypoglycemic drugs with the aim of lowering blood glucose levels into the pathologically-hypoglycemic range. Deliberate administration of insulin analogs may be difficult to prove because they might not have epitopes or containing low affinity epitopes that are the targets of antibodies used in particular assay kits.
A 34 years old woman was admitted to the Endocrinology Research Centre in September 2021 with a diagnosis of hypothyroidism and diabetes mellitus. Upon admission she complained of high glycemia indexes up to a maximum of 34 mmol/l ( 612 mg/dl), high TSH and low free T4 ( fT4) concentrations, despite reporting regular levothyroxine administration at a dose of 200 mcg per day. Under nursing supervision, her fT4 was rapidly normalized suggesting non-compliance as the cause of low thyroid hormone milieu. Glycemic fluctuations from 33 to 2.1 mmol/l (594 to 38 mg/dl) according to glucometer measurements were observed against the background of Lis-Pro insulin therapy, while no hyperglycemia was registered in venous blood and in the interstitial fluid concomitantly with the values found by glucometer. It was assumed that the patient's fingers were intentionally contaminated with glucose solution. Factitious hypo- and hyperglycemia were suspected. During yet another episode of hypoglycemia (1.86 mmol/L, 33 mg/dl) venous blood was drawn. Low to low-normal insulin and C-peptide values were found: 2.2 µU/ml (Roche kit) and 1.18 ng/ml, respectively. Therefore, insulin concentration in the same sample was re-tested with another kit (Abbott) and a significantly elevated value of 89.9 µU/ml was detected. Based on these results, FH was confirmed due to exogenous administration of an insulin analog undetectable by the Roche kit.
This clinical example illustrates to draw attention to multiple manipulations employed by subjects with Munchhausen Syndrome. In addition, this diagnosis may be further complicated by the laboratory use of immunoassay kits incapable of detecting some insulin analogs."

It has been demonstrated that hypothyroidism is associated with negative health outcomes that have a significant impact on quality of life. The aim of this study is to assess the relative significance of various parts of quality of life satisfaction in adult patients with hypothyroidism. This study has never been done in Saudi Arabia. No previous research was conducted in our region to highlight the quality of life of these patients. From this, it is very important to acknowledge the impact of hypothyroidism on quality of life, to help improve their lives and reduce the burden of the disease. Method This is a case-control study conducted on patients with hypothyroidism presented to the family medicine clinic at King Abdulaziz University Hospital. The participants were divided into two groups: patients with primary hypothyroidism (cases) and euthyroid subjects of the same age without chronic illnesses (control group). We used the Short Form-12 questionnaire (SF-12) and a sociodemographic questionnaire as a tool to assess the quality of life. Results Compared to healthy euthyroid controls, patients with hypothyroidism had a significantly reduced quality of life regarding their physical (p<0.001) aspect, with mental health not being affected. Smoking, female gender, and BMI showed significant associations with their mental health status (p=0.021, p=0.001, and p=0.045) respectively. Conclusions Regarding the results of the current study, there is a reduced level of physical health in patients with hypothyroidism than in healthy controls, which adversely affects their QoL. Smoking, gender, and BMI were associated with lower mental health among patients with hypothyroidism, which adversely affected their quality of life. Health practices should include assessment of the quality of life, monitoring by specialized physicians, and educational programs for these patients."
